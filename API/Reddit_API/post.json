        "text": "GENEVA (17 January 2022) \u2013 Taliban leaders in Afghanistan are institutionalizing large scale and systematic gender-based discrimination and violence against women and girls, a group of UN human rights experts\\* said today.\n\nThe experts reiterated their alarm expressed since August 2021 at a series of restrictive measures that have been introduced since the Taliban\u2019s takeover of Afghanistan, particularly those concerning women and girls. \u201cTaken together, these policies constitute a collective punishment of women and girls, grounded on gender-based bias and harmful practices,\u201d the experts said.\n\nThese exclusionary and discriminatory policies are being enforced through a wave of measures such as barring women from returning to their jobs, requiring a male relative to accompany them in public spaces, prohibiting women from using public transport on their own, as well as imposing a strict dress code on women and girls.\n\n\u201cIn addition to severely limiting their freedom of movement, expression and association, and their participation in public and political affairs, these policies have also affected the ability of women to work and to make a living, pushing them further into poverty,\u201d the experts said. \u201cWomen heads of households are especially hard hit, with their suffering compounded by the devastating consequences of the humanitarian crisis in the country.\u201d\n\nOf particular and grave concern is the continued denial of the fundamental right of women and girls to secondary and tertiary education, on the premise that women and men have to be segregated and that female students abide by a specific dress code. As such, the vast majority of girls\u2019 secondary schools remain closed and the majority of girls who should be attending grades 7-12 are being denied access to school, based solely on their gender.\n\nFull announcement: [https:\/\/www.ohchr.org\/EN\/NewsEvents\/Pages\/media.aspx?IsMediaPage=true](https:\/\/www.ohchr.org\/EN\/NewsEvents\/Pages\/media.aspx?IsMediaPage=true)"

By official I mean, are they written in legal documents or made legitimate under other similar forms? Or are they just announcements made by representatives of the Taliban government?\n\nI would appreciate any helpful answers. Thank you for reading!"

The world is watching and the world is with you. \n\nThe news we see around the world about Afghanistan is often very scary, demoralising, and incredibly disheartening. What is life really like for the people living there? Is the Taliban government actually here to stay? \n\nIt's still unbelievable to me as an outsider watching the news, but I can't even imagine what it must be like for all the women, children, and men in the country. Sending you all peace, love, and happiness from abroad. I know you will make it out of this."

        "text": "MARJA, Afghanistan \u2014 The tea was hot. The room, oppressive and dusty. And the Taliban commander I sat across from in a bullet-scarred building in southern Afghanistan had tried to kill me a little over a decade ago.\n\nAs I had tried to kill him.\n\nWe both remember that morning well: Feb. 13, 2010, Marja district, Helmand Province. We were about the same age: 22. It was very cold.\n\nMullah Abdul Rahim Gulab was part of a group of Taliban fighters trying to defend the district from the thousands of American, coalition and Afghan troops sent to seize what at the time was an important Taliban stronghold. He didn\u2019t know it when we recently met, but I was a corporal in a company of Marines that his fighters attacked that winter morning so many years ago.\n\nWith the insurgents\u2019 victory in that 20-year war secured this summer, Mr. Gulab, now a high-level commander, was sitting with me in Marja\u2019s government headquarters, a mess of a building the Americans had refurbished years ago. I was his guest, along with two of my colleagues from The New York Times. I told him that the fight for Marja had been important in the eyes of the United States, but that most people had heard only one version of the story of the battle. Not the Taliban perspective.\n\nIt was 2010, and the Taliban were once again becoming a potent military force, threatening nearly every part of Afghanistan. In Marja, the insurgents were taxing local residents, administering cruel and quick justice, and taking in a significant amount of income from the poppy harvest.\n\nOperation Moshtarak, as the U.S. military called the 2010 mission to seize the district, was the first set-piece battle of President Barack Obama\u2019s counterinsurgency troop surge, which failed.\n\nEleven years later, Mr. Gulab and I still remember the call to prayer that February morning in the village of Koru Chareh, a hamlet set amid half-flooded poppy fields, not far from the center of Marja. The surrounding trees, leafless, looked like dead outstretched hands.\n\n\u201cThe skies over Marja were full of helicopters, and dropped American soldiers in different areas,\u201d Mr. Gulab said.\n\nI had just moved with my team of seven other Marines to a small mud-brick pump house, having landed with more than 250 other troops a few hours earlier. As the sun rose, Mr. Gulab gathered his band of Taliban fighters from a nearby village.\n\nSoon after, the mullah, loud and angry, came over the mosque loudspeaker. Mr. Gulab and his Taliban fighters prayed.\n\nThen the shooting started.\n\n\u201cIt was a very tough fight,\u201d Mr. Gulab said.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t wrong. By the end of the day, a Marine engineer was dead and several others wounded. The insurgents suffered their own casualties.\n\nWith the war ending this August, the places where I had once fought as a Marine are now reachable again \u2014 stretches of land where my friends died and I watched my country\u2019s military failures unfold. Now, as a journalist for The Times, I wanted to return to report on what had changed, and what hadn\u2019t, on and around these former battlefields.\n\nIn November, my drive back to the district, now controlled by the Taliban, was easy enough. The roads were busy with motorbikes and trucks packed with cotton. The pavement was pockmarked with craters from the roadside bombs the insurgents had once placed beneath them. Abandoned military and police outposts dotted the highway like sporadic Stonehenges.\n\nMarja was as I remembered, but some things had changed. There was a paved road. The canals were dry.\n\nAnd the war was over.\n\nThe fall\u2019s cotton harvest was underway, the sound of tractor engines and chattering field hands now audible in the absence of the background noise of gunfire, though a withering drought is threatening many farmers\u2019 financial lifelines and the country\u2019s economic downturn has affected everyone.\n\nThe two-story building we had once occupied as a command center, where my friends Matt Tooker and Matt Bostrom were shot that day in February, was now a midwives clinic.\n\nOn this trip back to Marja, men weren\u2019t allowed inside. But through the cracked door, I could see the steps where my wounded friends had sat, bandaged, on painkillers and smiling, before the evacuation helicopter swooped in.\n\nAround the same time that a Taliban marksman put a burst of gunfire into my teammates, Mr. Gulab lost one of his fighters \u2014 as if the pendulum of violence that played out that day was trying to balance itself.\n\n\u201cMy friends were shooting at the foreigners from a garden and one was killed,\u201d Mr. Gulab said, before explaining how his men planted explosives meant for advancing Marines like me.\n\n\u201cFor each I.E.D., one Talib was there to detonate it,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Gulab joined the Taliban in 2005, a year before I enlisted in the Marines. He had just lost two brothers in the fighting, both Talibs.\n\nI grew up in the Connecticut suburbs. Mr. Gulab grew up in an isolated and mountainous part of Helmand Province.\n\n\u201cWhen I was child I was going to the madrasa, and our mullah was telling us, \u2018The foreigners want to occupy our country, and you guys, you should be ready to defeat them,\u2019\u201d Mr. Gulab explained. \u201cI hoped to join the mujahedeen.\u201d\n\nBy the time I landed in Marja, Mr. Gulab was a seasoned fighter who had survived American airstrikes as the steady churn of U.S. and NATO troops flooded into southern Afghanistan. He was in charge of about 60 fighters and understood how to navigate the rules of engagement that kept foreign troops from killing unarmed Taliban fighters who tossed their weapons into the nearest ditch.\n\nWhenever U.S. forces got close, Mr. Gulab said, \u201cwe would drop our weapons and then come out on the streets and say \u2018hi\u2019 to them, and they\u2019d ask us, \u2018Where are the Taliban?\u2019 and we\u2019d reply, \u2018We don\u2019t know.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter that, kids and villagers would collect our weapons and keep them in their homes until we got them back.\u201d\n\nMr. Gulab said his fighters would use children to spot patrols and call his men as soon as the Americans left their posts. He mentioned it as a casual aside, but a decade ago, as we started to learn that 8-year-olds were putting our friends\u2019 lives at risk, we wondered \u2014 and argued about \u2014 how far we\u2019d be willing go to make sure none of us died in a war we had already realized we were losing.\n\nAs Mr. Gulab recounted his memories of all the ways his friends killed my friends and vice versa, I looked at his rifle next to my right arm. He had propped it in the chair next to me before I sat down. It was an American M4 carbine, much like the one I carried in 2010.\n\nFor a brief moment I was in between time, between the beginning of my war and its end.\n\nThe rifle was a familiar tool, once an extension of myself and always within arms reach. But now that it was no longer needed, it was little more than a mass of plastic and steel, and it had no bearing on how I interacted with Marja and Mr. Gulab. He was no longer an enemy but a man sitting on the floor, pondering his next sentence. He wasn\u2019t fighting in a war that seemed like it would never end. And neither was I.\n\nHe had won his war. I had lost mine.\n\nI went home from Afghanistan in July 2010. Five years later, the Marja district collapsed to the Taliban, except for a few outposts. Then this summer, roughly two weeks before Kabul fell, the Taliban seized it completely.\n\n\u201cI am very happy that foreigners left the country and it is over,\u201d Mr. Gulab said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to kill them, and they are not killing my friends.\u201d\n\nThroughout the interview, I wanted to tell him I had been a Marine. That I had been in Marja on Feb. 13, 2010, and that I had fought against him. I wanted to say I was sorry for all of it: the needless death, the loss. His friends. My friends.\n\nBut I said nothing. I stood up, shook his hand, smiled.\n\nAnd I left Marja."

(even before 22h constant shouting is not allowed but i am sure everyone around can tolerate a bit of noise).\n\nI'm not saying u can never have a celebration or a party, everyone has reason to celebrate from time to time.\n\nBut it is an apartment, not a bar, not a social gathering place, there are places for this where u can go.\n\nIf u want the freedom to make as much noise whenever u like, search for a house without neighbours.\n\nPeople have to work, children have to study and all have to sleep, definitely on weekdays.\n\nYou came to live in a quiet street in a residential neighbourhood.\n\nFor as long as i have lived there the are neighbours are friendly to each other, they help you if you need help (and they can).\n\nSo i hope for you it is clear we all live there with in good respect of all and we do expect the same.\n\nIf there's anything u need u can always contact me on 0032xxx1 or xxx@hotmail.com  \n \n\nKind regards,   \n\n\n  \nIf anyone has any other insights i would appreciate to hear them!"

Therefore it would be wise for NRF to start its campaign of infiltrating rural areas to setup a support base. This would include recruiting fighters, storing weaponry, planning attacks etc.\n\nMy concern here is that, how would they going to it. What tactics should they use to get the rural areas and its people on their sides??? basically\n\n\\-Talibs used the religious route; using the mosques and madrasa as a recruitment and indoctrination point, and persuading its locals to engage in talibs Jehad. This was and is a very effective strategy, since most rural areas are ultra religious and very susceptible to such propaganda. So much so that Even ISIS-K terrorist is using it.\n\n( I also think this was how talibs were able to reach and influence the north of the country, in majority non-pashtune areas. hence why there is much more uzbek talibs as they were 20 years ago) .\n\nNote how talibs failed to recruit shia hazara's, compared to other ethnic groups.\n\nI think NRF best bet is using a mixture of nationalistic, religious and talibs failures to provide rural populaces basic needs. Should they also use ethnic reasoning to gain followers?? specifically in the north?? what do you guys think?? give you thoughts in the comment.\n\nUltimately if resistance is going to challenge talibs rule, they must dethrone talibs from the rural areas first and final, as we know the city and urban population already hate talibs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Amazing pic of Commader Masoud in panjshir.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/defihqc9wo781.jpg?width=563&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7c5379653b7ca7f1566fceb3a4664c55447efd09)"

I know many afghans who speak farsi or pashto, but are illiterate in the languages. \n\nSo I tried to gather some resources and tips for farsi dari. Here they are: \n\n(Started my farsi dari literacy journey in June, am reading harry potter in farsi now btw). \n\n- The very first thing is learning the alphabet with a simple pic from google. And this farsi dari alphabet song can help with the pronunciation: https:\/\/youtu.be\/kDigXODvGBY. \n\n- Because of Covid there are classes on youtube for the first three grades of school on https:\/\/youtube.com\/channel\/UC1EAhsyLN_CIxjgkJg1-q1A. \n\n- There\u2019s some resources online made by the US military. Those can be the next step. I wouldn\u2019t waste too much time on that though. A good week or two should help enough. Also feels very wrong to use those resources. \n\n- Buy \u2018Dari, an elementary textbook\u2019. It has a cd which is very helpful.\n \n- There\u2019s free online farsi language childrens books from Kabul University on here: http:\/\/acku.edu.af\/product-category\/e-portal\/free-books\/. \n\n- WHILE u are doing all of this: EMERGE urself in farsi media. Follow people on insta, twt, tiktok that write in farsi. Helps tons. Here\u2019s some accounts I enjoy on tiktok: @zackarnia , @dukhtarkabuli and @deeesinterlude. \n\n- There\u2019s farsi kids language books by Idries Shah u can buy on bookdepository.com\n\n- Try to write words in ur notes app. Just some vocab. Ur parents can help. \n\n- Write! To ur friends\/family who are also literate in farsi. Especially on messaging apps. Don\u2019t underestimate how much it helps to message ppl in ur native script and language."

(I'm in the United States.)\n\nA few months earlier, I one time used the Roshan website but now it will not work with any of my bank cards - it says 'we cannot authorize a transaction with your bank.' BUT actually a few months back when I called my bank and they said no, we are not stopping the transaction ... So it appears the problem is with the business Roshan. \n\nAnyway, the ding website does not work either. I tried PayPal there too and it did not work.\n\nI want to top up some of my friends in Afghanistan. Please help. I appreciate your suggestions \ud83d\ude4f"

        "text": "Obviously, one of the few big problems facing the NRF is that no neighboring country stands by them like Pakistan does with the Taliban (apart from various rumors about former Air Force personnel organizing in Tajikistan & Uzbekistan). Those reading this may remember the ad hoc militia cobbled together in Kulob, Tajikistan which the Tajik government prevented from crossing the border into the northwest of Badakhshan Province.\n\nQuestion is, is there no way to travel into Tajikistan's Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province out east, and then creep south into Wakhan District? Seems like the former is remote enough that there can't be too many authorities out there, nor is there any way the Taliban have anyone stationed all the way out to the Chinese border in the latter (if they maintain any presence in Wakhan at all after quickly raising some flags in August).\n\nI may be very uninformed, but it just seems to me that Wakhan District is a natural staging ground for the movement, even if initial logistics for survivability would be a growing pain."

        "text": "Hello all,\n\nI'm working with an Afghan family (former interpreter, wife, and kids) to help evacuate them from Afghanistan. Given some paperwork issues, their SIV will take a long time to process, longer than is safe for them to stay in the country (he's known to have been a former interpreter and has already received death threats). Therefore, we're applying for Humanitarian Parole for the family, which might allow them entry into the US while the SIV processes. However, neither the family nor myself have the money to pay the exorbitant filing fees ($575\/person) for Humanitarian parole, so we're looking for a US citizen\/green card holder who meets the fee waiver guidelines to act as their applicant. The applicant wouldn't have to do anything except sign a form for the lawyer who is preparing the application. \n\nThe guidelines for who qualifies for a fee waiver is limited to anyone who meets any of the following criteria:\n\n- Applicant makes under [150% of the HHS Poverty Guidelines](https:\/\/www.uscis.gov\/i-912p)\n\n- Applicant, applicant's spouse, or the head of the household where the applicant lives receives a means-tested benefits (i.e. Medicaid, SNAP, Pell Grant, Section 8 housing, etc.)\n\n- Applicant is experiencing financial hardship (this is really broad - could be student loan payment, medical bills, helping a family member, etc.)\n\nTo further expand on the financial hardship category, USCIS writes for that category: \"If you or any family members have a situation that has caused you to incur expenses, debts, or loss of income, describe the situation in the box below. Specify the amounts of the expenses, debts, and income losses in as much detail as possible. Examples may include medical expenses, job loss, eviction, and homelessness.\" My lawyer believes this broad category leaves a lot of wiggle room.\n\nIt's surprisingly been difficult to find anyone meeting any of the above guidelines, and I'm really trying all avenues to find an applicant for the family. If you or someone you know fits the criteria and would be willing to act as applicant, please message me ASAP. This will all be conducted through a lawyer to ensure everyone's personal information stays secure."

I believe the people of Afghanistan don\u2019t agree with these figures either. So far, no one has died of starvation,\u201d Hanafi said to Pajhwok Afghan News Agency on 15 December. \n\nAccording to the World Food Program, \u201can estimated 98% of Afghans are not eating enough, with seven in 10 families resorting to borrowing food, which pushes them deeper into poverty,\u201d Reuters reported. \n\n\u201cThe spiraling economic crisis, the conflict and drought has meant the average family can now barely cope,\u201d Tomson Phiri, global spokesperson for the UN agency said at a briefing in Geneva on 14 December. \n\n\u201cWe have a huge amount to do to stop the crisis from becoming a catastrophe,\u201d She added, calling the situation \u201can avalanche of hunger and destitution\u201d. \n\nDespite rejecting the UN headed World Food Program, Hanafi did raise the concern of poverty and drought in Afghanistan, yet asserted that Afghans will not die of starvation. \n\nHe also added that \u201cMuslim countries were duty-bound to help alleviate poverty in Afghanistan\u201d, while also stating that \u201cthe economic situation in the country was improving\u201d, Pajhwok Afghan News reported. \n\nThe United States has, again, denied the unfreezing of $9.5 billion in Afghan reserves. White House press secretary Jen Psaki stated on 14 December at a press conference that the US does not have plans of unfreezing the funds. \n\nThe current Afghan government, as well as China, have demanded that the US release the frozen assets, accusing them of using the reserves as bargaining chips to exert political pressure on the Taliban, and worsening the humanitarian crisis. \n\nOn 13 December, World Bank donors approved a transfer of $280 million in humanitarian relief for Afghanistan. The aid is expected to bypass the country\u2019s acting Taliban-led government, and will be transferred to two different aid agencies by the end of the month."

We mostly work with Spanish- speaking children but with the crisis will be getting minors from Afghanistan soon. I have two things that I need help with and I'm searching everywhere for solutions:\n\n1) When they arrive, they're required to take an assessment to determine their education level in their native language, but I have no idea where to find one in Persian\/Dari or Pashto. I've tried searching in English but all I can find are things for people who are trying to learn Farsi. \n\n2) My teachers and I have plenty of materials and resources for teaching them ENL, but I'd like to provide them with \"autodidactic\"\/independent reading and activities in their native language in science, social studies, math, reading comprehension, etc., and again, all I can find are things for people who are trying to learn Persian\/Pashto. We can definitely use Google translate for some things but PDFs would be too hard.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions for where I can find either of these two things? Or what I can try searching for? Anything that will help in assessing these kids?  I'm getting desperate"

For the past four years, the family lived in a tent in a camp for internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Qala-e-Naw in Badghis province.\n\n\"Afghan young girls (are) becoming the price of food,\" leading Afghan women's rights activist Mahbouba Seraj told CNN. \"Because otherwise their family will starve.\"\n\n[https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2021\/12\/02\/asia\/afghanistan-parwana-girls-marriage-intl-hnk-dst\/index.html](https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2021\/12\/02\/asia\/afghanistan-parwana-girls-marriage-intl-hnk-dst\/index.html)"

The only feeble defence of the Taliban and their sales pitch revolved around the myth of stability that the region could benefit from. With that hope fading fast, the days of proxies and perpetual war are back with no real regional winners."

        "text": "These are the facts: \n\n1: They're 1.2 million afghan diaspora living outside of afg (except pakistan and Iran) and that number is growing right now. Lets say 90% despise talibs, and from that 90% around 30% is able or care enough to support  resistance via monthly payments, yearly or just one of payment. That is around 300k of afghan diaspora alone, on top of that people in the west who also despise these savages and care enough to support the resistance with $, mostly non government people and organization. \n\nWith just 5$ we could get 1.5$ million , enough for a guerilla campaign for few key provinces and to concentrate in panjshir. (also 900$ million of remittance is send to afg yearly)\n\n2:  IN regards to recruiting that is no issue. A good number of population already hate these terrorist. 40k died fighting them past 20 years. 100k civilian and government workers were killed by them in the past 20 years. Oppression, tyranny, terrorism and most of all hopelessness for the new generation who hasn't lived in talib regime before are enough factors to turned even more towards resistance. Keep in mind women and other minority. Their current and ongoing atrocity, and being a slave to pakistan is too much fuel for the resistance. Also poverty is a major factor for those that want financial benefit from funds, as ISKP is also using it to recruit its terrorist . Talibs also did it in the past 20 years.  \n\n3:  All this depend on mostly 2 things;     \n\n1) legality of NRF, as in its legal to support and advocate for them in the west.\n\n2) there is no\/ hardly any corruption or criminality involved in the NRF, which I  \nthing could be extremely difficult and the main thing that could jeopardies it,   \nas it happened with northern alliance and previous government.\n\n(Positive Note, since NRF will depend on individuals on income, it will make corruption   \nmuch more difficult as it is given utmost attention or people will just stop sending funds)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo overall It is looking very bright for resistance as time passes. Also If someone has ahmad massouds contacts please send this writing to him as I have been thinking about this since 15 of august. \n\n I will also keep thinking for more strategies and others should also do the same."

        "text": "I've asked this question so many times and nobody has a clue it's so goddamn annoying. Maybe today's the day.\n\nBasically, my defenders are all on stay back and they just stand still in front of my box. They start their tracking runs really late so opponent can get easy over top through ball. My two CDMs NEVER track back to help unless my opponent takes a century to attack which means it's mostly 4 on 4 and they get very easy through balls.\n\nOn the other side of it my opponents defenders will track nearly everything and as soon as I get the ball their entire midfield runs into the box to support. They have 8 players just sitting in the box blocking every shot and tracking every run. Then when they counter they can literally just press Y and they'll ALWAYS have a player that has made a perfect run and will be through 1 on 1. When I counter my forwards don't make runs forward and their players always beat mine to the box so it's 5 on 8 again.\n\nRn I play 4-2-2-2 defensive and 3-5-2 attacking. It's the exact same thing on both so attacking is always better for me since at least I have more options going forward. I've played many formations and tried many tactics. And my team is worth 3 mil. It's not the players. \n\nAny ideas?\n\nSome more things: when I miss a tackle wether it was manual or if I literally just wanted to run into them my players will go sliding away and is instantly out of the picture. Not great when it's always 4 on 4. Flip side they miss a tackle and they don't slide at all and instantly recover to tackle me.\n\nWhen I'm in my half of the pitch a lot of the time their team will start pressing PERFECTLY. Every time I try to get the ball to one of my midfielders or forward players it will be intercepted and my player will make no effort to go for it first. And ofc, flip side, mine simply don't do that."

Or a button to press? \nI mostly Play the cdm and try to stand in passing lanes. But my CPU so nothing. Every single time...they don't even do a skill nove. They just run.

        "text": "So, imagine. It's late night, You are playing the last match in division rivals before going to bed  and you are winning 2-1 in the first half and everything is going well. Life is good. With that win you are gonna get the next level of the weekly prizes that are about to come out in 5 hours. There is little difference with the prizes of the previous level but getting more credits and better quality packs is always good. Suddenly the disconnection from the EA server pop-up appears on your screen. Ok, you are angry but it happens. (After all it's an EA game, you can't ask to a billionaire company a decent and stable server to play a game for which millions of people basically spent 100\u20ac.) Then you remember that even if the disconnection from the EA server it's not your fault, even if you are winning the match so you have no reasons to disconnect and it is only the first half of the match, the game is going to count the match as a loss for you. You Pray that finally the developers have fixed this problem after years, you go to check and ........ no, you are now two fuc**** win away from the level you need to be to get the fuc*** prizes you wanted. Tonight You have no time to play two others fuc**** matches, you are not going to get those fuc**** prizes and now you have to wait another fuc**** week to get better fuc**** prizes.\nThe end.\n\nSo if there is a FIFA developer in this thread and you read this, PLEASE, FIX THIS THING. IT'S SUPER ANNOYING. Why the consequences of a problem generated from the game have to be paid by the players? This thing is so fuc**** stupid. \nEvery year this company gets an incredible amount of money and still don't fix stupid shi* like this. \nUnbelievable."

There was so much delay my players weren't even doing what I wanted them to do. Passes were going to the wrong players, players weren't even shooting in front of a wide open net and it felt more like fighting against the game than the opponent.\n\nBut after playing a few games today, it feels like the players are (somewhat) doing what I want them to and most of the mistakes are just because I'm a bad player. Passes are still not going to the right people, but it doesn't feel as delayed or like my players are running in molasses.\n\nIs it just me or did I just get a few lucky games in a row?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I just played a game that was incredibly unresponsive... Looks like they didn't really fix anything but ended up making passes less accurate. WTF EA? Now we have to fight against shoddy gameplay as well as hope and pray our passes go to the right players?"

I play in World Class. \n\nNow I am aware that there is some scripting in the game like equalizers at the last minute or small teams suddenly play like prime Barcelona. \n\nBut with FIFA 22, I am currently in my third season (just got promoted to Premiership) with a custom team and the scripting is just unbearable. Every game it\u2019s the same. Team falls back, I lose the ball and the AI just score a goal using 1-2s all the way with zero positioning or pressing from my midfielders and defenders. I am frantically trying to tackle the ball but the AI just breezes past me or if I touch the ball it goes back to the AI. \n\nAlso the rare games when I actually manage to score and I start to get control of the game, the AI GK turns superhuman and saves everything. Then out of nowhere the AI gets a counterattack and score. \n\nI have a decent team, average around 78-79 but I only have 9 wins and 14 loses with negative GD.\n\nIs anyone having this same issue? I am losing my mind trying new tactics, formations, etc and get the same result."

I've checked my game plans and made sure that for attacking it should stay in 4-3-3 but this still happens. Anyone else noticed this?"

I've been trying to get back into UT after a few years away from it but I just can't stand this game it's so unfair. I feel like the game has more of a decision over who wins rather than who is actually better. (I'm not amazing at FIFA but I'm not bad either) I just constantly feel like I'm being screwed over for no reason and I've felt this on other FIFA's just not to this extent. Passing and through balls are more of a lottery than they ever been, this hypermotion (addition to the next gen versions for those unaware) has really annoyed me players are constantly taking needless touches which completely screw you over every time without fail (on every mode not just UT), tackling requires at least fifteen tackls before you keep possession whereas before it was just ten.\nIt seems like with this FIFA EA just made everything worse or am I the only one who thinks this?"

Probably a smart move, but why not pepper in some of the IP they already have without outright relying on it as a core part of the game.  There is no downside.\n\nThis would open up a whole new thing to grind for and it should be a completely different system then FUT\n\n4) ok the clothes and stuff are cool but seriously give us the option of putting on colored tank top jerseys to tell the teams apart during the game.  It can be a user option \n\nThanks EA I'm available for consulting"

It's a brilliant set up for potentially one of the greatest scifi franchises ever (if they stick the landing of the next part). Hans zimmer complementing the visuals was an absolute spectacle. This movie is going to age like fine wine- specially when the next part gets released. Finger's crossed I hope they keep the momentum going in the sequel, with everything they have set up. Don't think I've been this excited over anything scifi this much in a long time. That's it guys just wanted to share my thoughts \u270c\ufe0f. If anyone has watched it quite recently\/or before, I want to hear your thoughts!!! I definitely think ill give it a second watch as it's quite dense in terms of world building and storytelling. I feel like I'd generally just appreciate it on the whole alot more as well. Truly what you would call a modern space-epic."

        "text": "When I first saw the movie, I overall liked how combat was presented, but the combat\/fighting scenes still left me wanting more.  After watching the movie a few more times, I think I now know why.  \n\nBasically, Villeneuve visualized combat as much more \"grounded\" than I would have expected.  He doesn't film the combat and shield fighting in a stylized or fantastical manner as is typically seen in current superhero films or even the Lord of the Rings movies. The combat is filmed more like an historical war movie.  Whether this approach works is a matter of preference, of course.  \n\nThe two times I recall him going for more stylized combat is Duncan's fight with the Sardaukar in the palace and Paul's vision of the jihad (this latter one is almost TOO stylized).  \n\nWhat do you all think of combat in the movie?  Should combat have been more stylized in Dune 2021?  Should Denis take a different approach in Part 2?"

Lots of people have pointed this out. \n\nIt also resembles a human eye, and the scene in the movie where it \"gazes\" down at Paul made me think of Nietzsche's famous quote:\n\n*\u201cHe who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster . . . when you gaze long into the abyss the abyss also gazes into you\u201d* \n\nIt's an eye, and a black abyss.

I watched the 1984 film and then started the first book, but I didn't go past that because I got into a different book series at the time. \n\nI got back into it because of the new movie and the fact that a friend of mine sent me Dune on audible. I ended up getting the other 5 books and finished them all these past few months. I really enjoyed them, but I do have a few questions.\n\nI know that the bene gesserit have other memories from people in their ancestry. As I understand it, it continues to expand when they share with other bene gesserit. So it's just a huge accumulation of memories in one person from multiple ancestries.\n\nThey can confer with them for advice and get experiences from them. They have to fight to not lose control to a dominant memory the way Alia did.\nThey can talk to them and see things from their eyes, right?\n\nIn Chapterhouse Sheeana shares her memories with Tam, and they bond together over it. Darwi expalined that bene gesserit only share out of dire necessity or death. So they typically don't spend time together after the sharing. The juxtaposition of Sheeana's youthful potential and Tam's older wisdom was interesting to see. It seemed like they became endeared to each other.\n\nTam knew everything Sheeana was planning and didnt seem upset. Later, Da shares her memories with Sheeana and Murbella before meeting the \"spider queen\". \n\nDa also knew Sheeana's plans and didn't try to interfere or stop her. They both knew that she plotted this second scattering this with Duncan.\n\nWhen Murbella ascends to Mother Superior she takes Da's memories, which should include Sheeana's, right?\n\nIf that's the case, why did it take her so long to realize their plans to take the no-ship. Did I misunderstand Duncan's part in Sheeana's plan? Did he never intend to leave with her?\n\nI thought he said he wanted to escape and wanted Murbella to go with them before she became Mother Superior. \n\nHow much time passed after the sharing with Da and before Sheeana's escape? Was it like 1 day?\n\nThey made it seem like a few weeks passed at least. The constant tension of having the honored matres there, and Duncan and murbellas deteriorating relationship couldnt have happend overnight. \n\nDoes Murbella not have access to Sheeana from Da, or did she just ignore it because of how stressed she was? She was constantly talking to Da's memory in her head, so why the delay?\n\nHow exactly do the memories and sharing work? Can certain memories not transfer over or can they be blocked by the person receiving them? Can the memory refuse to speak? If the person in memory is still alive, can they block access to it?"

And the art design is a nice middle ground between Lynch\u2019s baroque maximalism and Villeneuve\u2019s brutalist minimalism. \n\nThe story really benefits from having 4.5 hours to tell it, which gives time to show Paul transition from a boy to a Fremen, from a Fremen to a naib, and from a naib to a jihadist messiah.\n\nThe intrigue subplot with Irulan and the Harkonnens is also quite good and the actress that plays her is excellent. The actor who plays Feyd isn\u2019t quite as talented though.\n\nI also wish they had devoted a little more time explaining mentats and why computers were outlawed. I find that to be such an essential aspect of Dune, but almost none of the live action adaptions address it directly.\n\nAll in all, though, when I decided to rewatch it, I expected it to have aged much less well than it did. Definitely worth a watch, especially if you haven\u2019t seen it before."

I agreed and said something to the effect of, \"You need a dictionary or some intricate knowledge of Muslim culture and language.\" They both looked at me like a had just thrown up a seig heil or something and they said 2 words to be the rest of the time I was there. I know I maybe didn't use the right verbiage calling is \"Muslim culture but I'm confused because my understanding is that the fremen are based on middle eastern people and culture and they are even supposed to be descendants of them in the book? Maybe I should have said they needed knowledge of Farsi or something? It was pretty weird and I was thinking that maybe they didn't realize the words were from Muslim culture but I'm not sure how since they literally say \"Jihad\" 100 times.

Frank Herbert however, sees a feudal interstellar society with no computers or artificial intelligence, and is governed by an imperial hierarchy.\n\nThe choice of style is unique to sci-fi and proves that a highly advanced society does not necessarily have to be governed by an evolved government. With enough thought, it can be governed by extremely outdated politics."

I mean you literally can\u2019t make that shit up (unless you\u2019re frank herbert). Anyways, the novel has been on my mind lately and I just recently read the first chapter of heretics. I was a bit skeptical to pick it up after reading god emperor because it felt like such a good conclusion. It was the build up of thousands of years of story. But I feel pretty good about reading heretics so far, it seems like everything I loved about GE is building to these final two. Would love some opinions, because I\u2019m still not quite sold on these last two novels to finish but I guess I may as well finish them at this point. I guess the point of the ramblings is to see how the last 2 frank books compare to the previous 4"

Part of this decision was simply wanting to know, 'WHAT HAPPENS NEXT!!!\" from where Part 1 left off - She's looking for spoilers.\n\nAlmost every day, at dinner, or at our coffee together before she heads to school, we discuss the days reading.  I LOVE IT!\n\nWhat I find fascinating is that she didn't have the context, historically, of the time Frank Herbert was living, and how the global politics' affect upon the middle east, upon oil, religion, and how that world of the 50's and 60's shaped the universe of Frank Herbert's Dune.\n\nNever did I think that any of my kids would engage in the vigorous discussion of Mid East Oil, embargos, Global shipping, arbitrary creation of states\/borders and such.   \n\nI am giddy to have someone to daily dive in!"

Don't get me wrong, the actress does amazing and I actually imagined her physically very similar but that is not at all how I imagined her personality or reactions.\nI read this sub often and I haven't seen anyone mentioning this and I wonder now if I totally misunderstood her when I read it, or if I am remembering her wrong. Does this bother anyone else? I am being picky? I don't have anyone to discuss this with and I'd love to know what you guys think? Specially those of you who have read the entire series?"

I read it, I enjoyed it, I barely understood it, and I figured that was it. Over the years I became of pretty big fan of StarWars, delving into other large universes once in awhile. But despite my knowledge of the existence of a greater Dune universe, I never took the initiative to check it out.\n\nThe Dune movie changed all that. I watched it because it looked cool and it was si-fi. What more could I ask for? Anyways, I watched the movie, enjoyed it, and decided to look up what happens to Paul, since the ending kinda left his story pretty wide open. And boy oh boy. From my research of the StarWars universe I am fully aware that I have only just scratched the surface, but I am already absolutely overwhelmed. I honestly thought Dune was about terraforming a desert planet, with some space politics and giant worms. Uh, yeah. About that.\n\nIn about 15 minutes I learned that >!Paul, the nice, family loving Paul, becomes a messiah emperor, uniting many worlds under his religious banner, and begins a violent and bloody religious crusade \/ eugenics program with a vision of ideal peace for humanity. Despite just culling entire bloodlines for peace, he denies his \"I've been bred to bear the perfect heir\" wife's attempts at reproduction, and instead has twins with his concubine, Zendaya. She dies in childbirth, and he promptly fucks off into the desert, leaving his children to raise themselves. He eventually returns, destroying everything he worked for on Arrakis, and is quickly assassinated by his sister who is possessed by a young version of the fat baron guy who had Pauls father killed. Oh yeah, and uh... Leaving his children alone didn't work out very well. One of them actually turns out alright, but the other one grows up to be a human-sandworm hybrid that rules the galaxy as a tyrant for 3.5 thousand years and is known as the God Emperor.!<\n\nI honestly believe that if I continue down this path, all the StarWars and Dune lore will collide in my mind and I will end up catatonic, so I may leave it at that, but who knows. Is Dune lore worth delving into? It's certainly interesting..."

I've only read the first book myself but I have some fairly clear knowledge on at the least the final chapters of the book. If you're worried about spoilers for me, don't worry. I'm more curious about this question than anything to be honest. I'd genuinely love to know what you love about the series. If you're worried about spoilers for me specifically then I'd say disregard that, but make a spoiler for any content someone else who's starting out may not want to know.

After Mohiam says she must consult with the other Bene Gesserit sisters before she gives a decision, Paul tells her to hurry as he will not sit idly by. Hayt\/Duncan then asks Paul if he will bargain with the Bene Tleilax and Paul says he hasn\u2019t made up his mind yet. The possibility of Paul doing this frightens Mohiam.

In the orgy, Fremen released the accumulated pressures of their own generic memories, and they denied those memories.  She saw her companions being temporarily possessed in the orgy.  For her, there was no such release, no denial.\"\n\nIn the first book we see Jessica use her Bene Gesserit training to turn the poison water into the water of life to make it safe for the others to drink.  The drinking of it leads to the orgy and shared memories and possession.  This is a very important part of the Fremen culture, and we are lead to understand that all Fremen experience this with some regularity.  \nMy question is, HOW?  \nThere are 10 million Fremen.\n\nIt seems to me that the choices are either 1) The Bene Gesserit planted 1,000 sisters on Arrakis so that each tribe had a Reverend Mother, or 2) somehow women without any Bene Gesserit training were able to learn how to change the water.  3) Most sietches had the orgy without the water of life.  But then, they wouldn't have been able to \"release the accumulated pressures of their own generic memories\".  \n\n\nI don't think there is a good answer here, but I'm curious what everyone thinks."

        "text": "So for starters I'm in my 20s but have never really read a book. I was a good student but for me reading  has always been associated with homework so I learned to loathe reading. However, I really want to get into the Dune story and I of course loved the movie.\nSince I can't really read without getting stressed from English class flashbacks I listened to the first Dune audiobook and I felt very lost and confused, but I still enjoyed it. Since I'm not a reader there's so much dialogue and plot points I miss. I had to revert to spark notes to figure out the ending haha.\nI found this guy on YouTube called Quinn's Ideas and I have to admit his recap of the first book was INCREDIBLE! I love the world and story but I feel bad that I just couldn't grasp it with the audiobook.\n\nI guess I apparently need some hand holding since I'm an hour in the second book and feel so lost again already, but I also feel bad getting the story spoiled. So does anyone know someone like Quinn's Ideas on YouTube who can help me along figuring out this incredible series? I would love to learn more than just the Spark Notes version, like learning all the little details and motives for the characters.\n\nEdit: thanks everyone for your advice. I think I'll try switching from the audio book to a physical, as difficult as it will be for me. At least that way I can go at my own pace and read the appendix along the way. Also thanks for all the links to videos and podcasts. It's also good to know I'm not the only one who hasn't understood the story first try. Can't wait to learn more about this amazing series."

The only drama or action we get is at the beginning with Siona fleeing the Forbidden Forest and the love triangle and plot against Leto at the end of the novel. Why is there so much filler in between? \n\nI guess the novel is a character study of a God-like ruler, but I found the character of Leto to be so dull until we finally get to see his tenderness with Hwi. Am I not reading into Leto's character enough? Am I meant to hate him? I didn't have a strong emotional response when he dies at the end of the novel, mostly because he is TOO inhuman for 80% of the story. On top of that, the relationship between Hwi and Leto has literally been designed and planned so nothing about it feels organic to me.\n\nBasically I found the novel to be way too self-indulgent in Leto's musings and lacked compelling character or dramatic moments to drive the story forward until shit actually started to happen at the end. I enjoyed the last 100 pages but I do not understand why there needed to be 400 pages in the middle. Thoughts?"

        "text": "EDIT: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE REWARD!!! Wow, it's my first time getting a reward. I'm really grateful \ud83d\ude4f\n\nAlso guys thanks for the comments! I didn't have time to read, I couldn't reply quickly sorry for that. \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n*1) I haven't read Children of Dune, I'm in the middle of Messiah.  But I've heard some things about the Golden Path and Leto 2. So here's the question:\n\nThe Bene Gesserit planned the Jihad to stop the stagnation of the gene pool. And they calculated the most controlled path to Jihad: The Golden Path.\n\nMy question is: Bene Gesserit Reverend Mothers have some prescient, which Jessica was referring to in the Box scene. \"All I ask you to see the future\" (Jessica to Helen Mohiam).\nWhen calculating the Golden Path, the Bene Gesserit foresaw everything that would happen and created a roadmap just like designing a level for a game?\n\n I think the ancient voices speaking within Paul in the new movie and guiding him through his choices are the voices of the Bene Gesserit. These voices had helped Paul reach the Fremen. By saying \"Let it go\" in the thopter scene, they directed Paul to lower the thopter and helped the characters survive the storm.  Thus, Paul was able to reach the Fremen, one of the necessary factors for the start of the Jihad.\n\nBut how did the Bene Gesserit, who planned this Golden Path, see a boy named Paul, a potential Kwisatz Haderach, will use a thopter in a storm and face the death? How did they know at that moment that the only way to save our Kwisatz Haderach will be make him descend the thopter? \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*2) Another question: Were Kwisatz Haderach and Lisan al Gaib planned as the same people?\n\nI know what these terms mean. Kwisatz Haderach is the last link of the Bene Gesserit gene program.  Lisan al Gaib is one of the chosen one (messiah) prophecies that BG has planted in many worlds and that if a member of the Sisterhood gets into a difficult situation, he can create a safe position for herself by manipulating the religion of the native people. \n\nEveryone answers this question differently. \n\nSome say it's pure coincidence that Paul is both Lisan al Gaib and Kwisatz Haderach; if someone other than Paul who knows how to fight but is not the Kwisatz Haderach had come, the Fremen would still acccept him as their messiah.\n\nHowever, some answers also point out that the Bene Gesserit deliberately made up messianic stories like Lisan al Gaib so that when KH was born and ready, he would hype these religious peoples affected by the prophecies and initiate the Jihad in the entire universe, and that this Lisan al Gaib prophecy was created only to match the Kwisatz Haderach prophecy. Like only the Kwisatz Haderach's features can fit the profile of Lisan al Gaib. Which of these is correct? The latter seems much more logical and \"planned\" to me.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*3) When Paul sees Jihad in the tent scene, he fears the violence the Fremen will unleash on the universe in his name. Meanwhile, he seeks revenge on the Emperor and Baron for the Fall of the Atreides. But why is he keep going to the Fremen who will cause Jihad?\nIn the book, he does this to survive, because if he gets out of Arrakis he will die since he has already consumed a large amount of spice. Cutting consuming spice will be fatal to him. \n\nIn the new movie, however, Paul \"voluntarily\" joins the Fremen just after being dismayed by the Jihad. This didn't make sense to me.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*4) This is my last question and it will be very incomplete since I only read until the middle of Dune Messiah, but I still want to ask it.  \n\nPaul actually sees the Golden Path all the time, right? Each vision he sees is actually images that guide him to follow the Golden Path. But in the tent scene, he sees a violent event on the Golden Path and is afraid of it: The Jihad. So Paul leaves the Golden Path, namely the safest route, and tries to stop the Jihad initiate. \n\nBut after a while, when Paul meets the Fremen, the Jihad has already begun and has already gained momentum that his sister will continue even if he kills himself.  \n\nDo I understand this correctly? In the first book, we read the book as if \"The Jihad is absolutely bad, Paul had to prevent it, but he has failed.\" The \"bad ending\" is not actually a bad ending at all, right? Because Jihad is necessary to follow the Golden Path, the safest route, but Paul is constantly trying to leave this route because of his fears and his ignorance of the Path. It's just a misunderstanding. To \"save\" the humanity with minimal damage, he must had accepted this and he should had listened his inner Bene Gesserit voices.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI know these questions are too long, but...\nThanks in advence."

        "text": "Spoilers for Dune Messiah and Children of Dune below. The whole matter of discussion is spoilerific.\n\nIn Children of Dune when Idaho and Jessica are taken prisoner by House Corrino and brought to Salusa Secundus we see Duncan Idaho attempt to kill himself by severing an artery on his bindings. We're not told why, though we have several instances of Farad'n reflecting on this and wondering why he did it. My question is... why did he do it?!\n\nThe scene happens during a discussion of how the political circumstances will play out. It was discussed that Alia would expect Jessica and Duncan to be killed, and be happy with that. There was also the suggestion of a marriage between Alia and Farad'n. But the trigger point of Duncan's action is this line from Farad'n:\n\n>\"We're toying now with the idea of accepting your offer, Lady Jessica, but Duncan Idaho should be sent back to his loving wife.\"\n\nStraight after this Duncan thinks about how pain is just a nerve signal, and he pushes against the restraints to sever an artery in his wrist.\n\nThe reactions are interesting. Jessica thinks to herself \"There was always a bit of foolishness in Duncan\". Farad'n, acting alarmed, said that he wasn't really going to marry Alia, to which Jessica says \"That's not why he cut his wrist.\"\n\nWhen Duncan recovers a little Jessica says to him \"Mentats should beware of absolutes.\" Duncan says he's \"tired\": \"You have no idea how tired I am.\" And Farad'n then follows with \"When it's overexploited, even loyalty wears out finally.\"\n\nFarad'n, studying Duncan later, has a very long period trying to figure out his motives. He thinks to himself, \"Why did Idaho try to kill himself? Was that really what he'd tried? He must've known we wouldn't permit it. Idaho remained a dangerous question mark.\" When later reflecting on Atreides loyalty he thinks \"Idaho was not acting in character.\" He later concludes, \"Whatever his motive, he had done it for the Atreides, for his ruling House. The Atreides were the star of his orbit. Somehow he things that my holding the Lady Jessica here strengthens the Atreides.\" But he doesn't seem satisfied with this conclusion, he reflects further on the political situation and the role of the Fremen, and thinks to himself again, \"Why did Idaho cut his wrists?\"\n\nWhat I find interesting is that after this very long section of Farad'n trying to figure out the \"why\" we never get any further answer on the matter. It remains unresolved, or open to the interpretation of the reader. It may be that the answer lies in the following Idaho-Jessica scene, where Duncan declares himself withdrawn from Atreides service and aligned with the Preacher. But that in itself a difficult scene to read, since we know *they* know there are spies watching and anything said could be intended as manipulation.\n\nMy first thought is that this is related to Alia, and the line about sending him back to her. But in his meeting with Jessica he makes clear that they've already separated ways. And he goes back to Alia anyway not that long later - he didn't bother trying to kill himself again, even when he realised Alia was plotting to kill him. Though he still has feelings for the Alia-that-was he doesn't seem to be emotionally controlled by that, and certainly not to the point of suicide.\n\nMy second thought is that he's doing this because he sees Jessica betraying the Atreides for the purposes of the Sisterhood, and knowing that Alia is also \"gone\" he has made the decision to abandon the Atreides. This realisation that he no longer serves the Atreides causes him to commit suicide. This is perhaps what Farad'n thinks when he mentions loyalty being pushed too far. I don't believe this though, because Ghanima is still alive and he does in fact end up giving up his life to ensure her safety. Much as he declares that he's giving up Atreides service I don't fully believe he'd do that. Or at the least he recognises that there are now competing Atreides factions, and he is aligned to the rebellious Preacher\/Ghanima faction rather than the Alia\/Empire\/priests faction.\n\nAnd both those thoughts above assume a genuine suicide attempt, which seems unlikely given Farad'n's reflection. He can't actually kill himself, so why bother? The attempt was to either make a statement or to fool the Corrinos.\n\nJessica seems to think he may be helping make her case. That by presenting Jessica as an enemy to him he's giving Farad'n more of a reason to align with her. But she also is distrustful of Idaho and thinks to kill him. Her reflection of \"There was always a bit of foolishness in Duncan\" must be considered with some insight. And indeed we see that this whole suicide attempt is a precursor for his real suicide later, where he drives Stilgar into murdering him so that Stilgar will be forced to go rogue with his sietch.\n\nMy last thought is that this is to do with the will of the Preacher. We know that Duncan has had private conversations with him, and that he strongly believes the Preacher to be Paul. He talks and thinks about how Fremen he has become in his meeting with Jessica. Jessica herself stops to think that he is being honest about leaving the Atreides and seems now aligned to the Preacher's bidding instead. The Preacher has earlier promised Duncan to Corrino service, and this action is part of convincing the Corrinos that he has truly left the Atreides for them. It may have been planned by the Preacher from the start.\n\nOne final thought, coming to me now as I type this out - the suicide attempt grabs Farad'n's attention. It makes him focus all the more on Duncan, and on the conversation Duncan has with Jessica. It establish Duncan as an enigma to be studied, and Farad'n openly thinks this over and over again as he monitors the ghola. Farad'n starts spying on Duncan closely after the wrist-cutting, even thinking that he would get reports of the meeting with Jessica but he wants to watch live himself. Jessica considers later that the whole meeting she acted almost automatically, as if Duncan has scripted the conversation out for them and she played her part. Was the suicide attempt purely a way of making Farad'n pay attention to the Idaho-Jessica conversation and absorb the triggering information from that interaction? If so that's not foolishness at all, and is some grand manipulation from Duncan Idaho! Or could even all this have been planned by Paul...? Jessica remarks that Duncan doesn't have the spice-vision to drive a conversation like that. Was he acting on a script narrated to him by the Preacher in advance?"

(One member is a huge sci-fi fan and it was her turn to select the book.) They had a bit of a rough time getting into the lexicon and vocabulary but really liked it once they got used to the terms and world. \n\nIn fact, they liked it so much, all of them went to see it together at the theater and came out absolutely RAVING! I believe it is a testament to Dune\u2019s worldbuilding and themes that they were able to connect with it. They are all so excited for Part 2!"

And if they are... how has nobody figured out that's why drilling for water doesn't work, by the time of Dune.\n\nFor the most important planet in the universe, a lot of people are very ignorant of the workings of Arrakis. And this wouldn't stand out to me as much if people in this book were *generally* incurious or ignorant; I'd chalk it up to the general pre-modern, feudal, stagnant vibe of the setting. But interest in Arrakis is chiefly economical; there's capitalism to work here and gargantuan profits to be made. It's weird to me that the planet remains a black box."

He remembers from his clearest vision that Bob's got a red shirt on next tuesday, and there's a bug in the street he should step over at 8:43pm when he goes out for a stroll, etc etc. The clearest vision he has is the one of the future he has been trying to resist, but he has no choice but to follow it or he will be truly 'blind' and have to walk off into the desert. He's not prepared to abandon his path yet *(I'm not exactly sure why)*\n3. **Paul loses his oracular vision**....**when\/why, exactly?** Does this happen immediately after she dies in child birth, out of the violent grief of Chani's death?  Or does it happen because he encounters Leto II, who did not appear in his visions because Leto II's prescience clouded his presence in Paul's oracular vision? IIRC he is already blind when he learns there are twins, but I might be mistaken"

Then I read the book and loved that as well but took note of what the film cut\/added. Now after rewatching it on delicious 4K Blu Ray with my knowledge of the book I liken the adaptation to Spielberg\u2019s adaptation of Jurassic Park. Michael Chriton\u2019s novel is great and so is the film. Some things work in a book that don\u2019t work on screen and vice versa. It\u2019s ok to love both."

        "text": "Sorry to bother,\n\nBut I am really confused about a portion of the first book where Yueh devises a plot to save Lady Jessica and Paul. So, please correct me if I'm wrong, but here is my understanding. \n\nYueh knows that Paul and Jessica will be caught and thus prepares the ornithopter for them with the seat belts cut. Once, Paul and Jessica board they manage to kill the guards, but they notice that another ornithopter was following them and so decide to run. But, infact it's Idaho who is in the ornithopter; by this logic.\n\nHere's where I am confused, how did Yueh know that Idaho would find the ornithopter (did Yueh give him prior instruction?)? Also, how would Idaho know that the harkonnens took over?\n\nSecond, how did Idaho know to go into the desert? Was he merely just following Jessica and Paul's ornithopter so that he could shoot it down, thinking that it had sardaukar or harkonnens? Or, did he know that Paul and Jessica were inside the thing and knew he had to follow it?\n\n\nFinally, what's up with the dukes ring? Why is the ring so important?\n\nApologies if I have gotten it all wrong, I am just really confused and it's bugging me a lot."

Leaves a lot of questions unanswered :\n\n1. how did they outlaw\/ban thinking machines without having a squad of equally or more competent thinking machines to enforce the ban ?  (\\*tips off hat to the Terminator franchise\\*)\n2. How come there are no black markets for trading in thinking machines (which would render any ban useless) ?\n3. How did it become a part of religious doctrine, and how did all schools of thought come to unilaterally adopt it?\n4. What happens when Dune-age analog computers become more intelligent? Is there a stage of intelligence at which point they are phased out? how is this determined? (in the 1960s Turing\/von Neumann et al were already discussing these things so not completely out of scope of the times, and we already had personal computers by the time the Encyclopedia came out.)\n\nOne part I admire though is how Herbert really thought through some of the downstream effects of this sort of de-industrialization - more feudalism, more authoritarian dynasties, more zero-sum games, more dogma, more wars, and  more in-fighting over resources."

        "text": "Hey all, so I just finished the Dune 2021 4k disc. Before that I only saw it in theater and HBO streaming. The 4k transfer is great. One thing I was interested to look for, and was able to confirm visually, was the 35mm film grain.\n\nFor those who don't know, Dune was actually shot on a 4K Arri Alex LF digital camera, then optically printed to 35mm filmstock, then scanned back to digital, believe it or not! In the HBO stream, I really only noticed the grain in the early dream sequences of Chani, they must have purposely used a high speed stock because there's tons of grain in that one shot. \n\nNow on the 4k disc, the grain is subtly present throughout. It adds a fine texture or softness to the image. It's noticeable in many closeups and I'm glad they didn't go crazy on the noise reduction or it would have been wasted. One area I think it almost didn't work in was the darker scenes. In the shadowy areas there is some kind of combination of grain and noise and perhaps even compression there that looks a little funky. 4k Blu ray is high bit rate, usually 100mb\/s but I'd imagine it's still possible for compression artifacts to show?\n\nFor reference I saw it on an LG CX OLED. In HDR mode. Not professionally calibrated, but I used settings recommended by different people: no dynamic tone mapping, no added contrast or sharpness, filmmaker mode, etc. \n\nWhat are your thoughts? Did you notice grain and did you find it pleasing? Was it worth the effort in your opinion?"

I know, it took me a long time to get through them, but I am still quite proud of myself, since this not only the first book series that I've finished, but also the first books that I decided to start reading myself out of pure interest. I always thought that books would be boring or not my kinda thing. But after reading Dune, I have found a new appriciation for books and how different they are from movies. In movies\/tv series, you simply don't get as much details about the characters, such as their thoughts\/motivations, which helps us understand them more. There are of course many other things that books does better, but I'm too lazy to type all that.\n\nAnyways, that's all I wanted to say. Now I gotta binge watch Quinn's Ideas' Dune lore videos."

        "text": "My husband hated it - but he's NOT a fan of sci fi, he couldn't get his head around the Matrix and the basic principle that 'real life' isn't real at all and yes, if you have the talent you can bend the rules.  So he didn't 'get' Dune and went to bed at the halfway mark.\n\nMy son, who has NO previous 'education' in the Duneiverse did watch it all the way through.  He is 20 and an intern in the natural gas industry, comes home on weekends.\n\nI've read the novels multiple times since I was in 7th grade and I always find something new, some subtle nuance that I missed before, and the novels have grown with me as I grow.\n\nI found the movie does a pretty damn good job adapting the first half of the first novel.  It is exposition heavy, but has to be since it's difficult to do internal voices.\n\nI did have to explain to Son, in the few quiet moments, about the Guild Heighliners and Navigators, why there are no 'thinking' machines, about the shields and how the fast strike won't penetrate but the slow one does, thus changing your timing and how in the novel, there is mention that a person too used to shield fighting can be at a disadvantage against someone not used to that necessary timing.\n\nI had to explain the Maker Hooks at the end when the closing shot is shown.  I had to explain Mentats, the Baron's suspensors, the significance of the Bull, The Bene Gesserit goals to develop the Kwistatz Haderach, and how Paul's ability would differ from Navigators and Mentats - the film didn't make  it clear the gendered 'way' the ability works.  It would difficult to cram that much information into just one film, after all.  I also had to explain Suk conditioning and how dramatic it is that Yueh broke that conditioning for the sake of his Wanna... and how deep the betrayal was and how long it echoes through the stories.\n\nHe did key into, almost immediately, that Paul is not destined to be the White Liberator of oppressed brown people, he's not the stereotypical white knight hero.  He liked that ultimately, these are all just people, living in various shades of gray... even the Harkonnens, who are brutal and cruel are a product of their culture and their world.  All of them are pawns of the Emperor.\n\nHe immediately recognized this story is the 'father' of Star Wars and the similarities between the two universes.\n\nHe ordered the first three books about 15 minutes after the movie ended - and he's not an avid reader.  He didn't want to just dl my kindle versions - he wanted the real thing to hold as he reads.  I heartily approved.  Digital media has it's place, but it's nice to have actual books for a variety of reasons.  I also recommended he dig out my controversial Dune encyclopedia and have it handy as he reads but I also explained it is but is not, official canon.  I do feel it will be helpful.\n\nI do still wish they'd have shown the conservatory and worked in the warning from Margot.  At the very least, have some sort of fanciful, water hungry plant with the message coded into the leaves as a warning come too late, but that's a very mild thing to be missing.  I get why they didn't show it.\n\nI do wish we'd have had the opportunity to see it in IMAX or at the very least on a big screen but it is what it is.\n\nThings I really enjoyed:\n\nThe worms.  Holy shit did they capture the scale and danger of them.  MAN those must have been amazing on the big screen (Side question for home viewers - the scene from the trailer where Paul and Jessica have made it to the rocks, when he's looking into the 'face' of Shai Hulud was GoT battle scene dark for us.  Was it that dark for anyone else? That scene was 97% black screen.  Everything else in the film was well lit.)\n\nThe various invented languages. Of them all, Sardaukar was the most unnerving and unnatural and I LIKE IT.\n\nI really enjoyed Bardem as Stilgar.  I GREATLY enjoyed his first appearance and how the character had complete disregard for offworld formalities.\n\nI enjoyed their concept of the Voice and the signed battle language.\n\nCrysknives were excellent, though I always imagined them more milky and translucent, and had a quality about them where they pick up the light and almost glow (not like CGI in your face glow, I mean like the opal quartz knife that often gets shown as a representation of what one could look like).  However, it makes more sense, from an evolutionary standpoint, that they're more dull.\n\nI greatly enjoyed  David Dastmalchian as Pieter de Vries, I could have done with more of him.  I loved how elegant his hands moved when gesturing and how cool and unflappable he was when addressing Rabban.  I think the actor could have really brought out the weirdness and unsettling, spooky nature of de Vries.\n\nThere are things I'd have enjoyed more of, but again, I understand the time constraints and the challenge to condense such a complex and nuanced story into a couple of hours.  All in all, I greatly enjoyed it.  I wonder how much the uninitiated might have missed - my son did pick up on the fact he was missing a LOT and asked questions.  Hopefully those with questions will pick up the novels and dig deep into them.\n\nI think that's all I can say right now - it was a late night, and there's not enough coffee in the world to get me super alert today."

I looked up about 20 different interpretations of chairdogs; some were dogs that were shaped like chairs and others were just fluffy loveseat-looking chairs with no face.

I\u2019ve tried switching to a different speaker to make sure that\u2019s not the issue and same thing.

I re-read the book a few weeks before the movie and was anticipating so many plot points that had been removed. >!I was so looking forward to the dinner party, Keynes death scene, and the conflict between Jessica and Gurney to name a few. I also was really hoping the movie would end just a few pages later as Paul gives water to the dead. !< I really liked the film but felt a little empty. It sucked because all my non-book-reader friends wouldn't shut up about how much they loved it.\n\nLast night I got the UHD and sat down to watch it after telling myself for months the film was very good but not great. Well, with the expectations gone I lost myself in this film. It was beautiful and such a love letter in tone and theme to the original. It is still a visual spectacal but these actors poured their souls into these roles. Denis created magic with the marriage of technical wonder and evocative storytelling. \n\nCOVID has been very hard for me and my family. Seeing Paul's struggles, his transcendence, and his possibilities flash before his eyes brought a very visceral feeling back to me. I felt it like I did the first time reading the books. It was cathartic. Maybe this was easier because I was alone, but I cried. It's amazing how Frank made this epic story with such tremendous consequences yet somehow relatable to someone like me where the greatest consequence in my life will simply be how kind I was to those close to me. And Denis NAILED it. This film is exactly what I needed right now. \n\nAnyway, I wanted to share my thoughts on re-watching post hype cool down. Did anyone else have a similar experience?"

If that\u2019s right how do the highliners travel from system to system? Wouldn\u2019t they have to have one above each destination then? In that sense they\u2019re more like gates than ships. It was my understanding from the book that everyone loads in and then the highliner travels to the destination. As a side note I found it interesting in the book that they\u2019re neutral territory and warring houses have to just fly side by side. Time in the book is kind of fuzzy and is there a possibility that the ships used to attack Arrakis were in the highliner that took them from Caladan? How much time exactly passed between them taking control and the attack?"

She was repeatedly shown with a bloody hand holding a knife, but just before the final blow Paul saw her OTHER hand also covered in blood.

        "text": "Warning: obviously I'll tag it but this will be spoilers of all spoilers. Analysis of spoilers. \n\nI'm stuck in bed and I have no one to talk about this with. I searched other posts and it's mostly weirdly butthurt people complaining in the form of a question about keynes gender swap. I actually want to ask about it, not bitch about it. Hoping someone can provide some actual insight for me. \n\nI'll lead by saying I am a woman, an engineer too. I'm thrilled with getting more badass and STEM women in film, and the actress in the new movie did a great job. Had I not read the books and known more, would never have thought to question it. \n\nMy issue is that it felt forced and wrong in a few ways. I started reading the books when the movie came out because my friend criticized my wide genre experience without any dune. So I decided to read the trilogy then watch the movie. Then I realized we had three more. And the author died. And we've got a whole universe here. And then actually there were tons more. It's been quite a month. I have so so many thoughs and even a conspiracy theory for fun I'll post sometime, but I'll stick to this question \ud83d\ude02. So I have read in this order:\n\nDune 1-3\nDune 4-6 (ie dune - chapter house)\nPrelude to dune 1-3\nLegends of dune 1-3 (about to finish house corrino)\n\nWatched the movie last night. A few thoughts. They did a great job I think, but how the actual hell would that movie make any sense without all the background!? They hint at, but dont explain, the navigators. Paul's million titles are thrown around without much context. I could literally go on for days with these. If I hadn't read the books I'd have walked away from that going \"what the hell happened in that movie\". They did the best I think could have been done with the time they had but like... Wanna and the doctor's story is so good and it's barely even glossed over. \n\nThat leads me to keynes. So if they don't ever plan to bring in keynes' (and a hell of a lot of all the other groups) back story and stop here, mostly cool on the casting. But lets assume they plan to make more and round out the universe. How do yall think they will address these:\n\n1) what's right isn't always how a culture can be portrayed. One of the coolest things about the Fremen is that their women could easily have been shoved aside as weak and pointless. The Fremen women might be the strongest group in the entire universe. They have an exceptionally firm grasp of roles and foresight for generations. They don't chose to be meek and submissive. A great example of a woman I consider to be an absolute gem is Liets mother. She chose to pursue Pardot and it can be read as \"you saved my brother I am beholden to serve you\" but it's more \"I desire to be the second half of your puzzle piece to work effectively as the best team\". She's always immediately aware of his needs, serving tea and such. She bears him a child. All things that make it SEEM like it might be some \"women are property\" stuff. But not remotely so. She takes her husbands strengths, knows them so well that she consciously fills every gap, and it's to allow him to focus on his vision which she believes in. If she's serving tea, it's because she knows he otherwise would have to stop what he was doing and he's bad at that. Girl straight up comes up with a 10 part rescue mission for her husband and child on the fly when a helicopter shows up. The worst thing the Fremen can do to someone is \"let the women have their way with them\". Everyone easily acknowledges that the women are more fierce then the men. More terrifying. \n\nSo issue one for me is, as it's stated once, something like 'Fremen women are losely connected to the world of the men through a thin thread to their husbands but otherwise live in their own world'. The women are portrayed as a self governing backbone. Had Liet been a girl, she would have been trained in the way of the tribal women. A total badass but doubtful a scientist. It seems more likely she'd be the most eligible bachelorette for a son in law to inherit planetologist. And that obviously has its own issues. And not because she couldnt handle it, but it would flow more to have her become a strong character in her own right as raised by the tribe. It wouldn't have been de facto expected like it was. She'd likely have different priorities, a different mindset. It doesn't mesh with their society and feels disjointed. \n\n2) It's doubtful the emperor would have blindly accepted her like he did Liet, signing the papers barely looking at them. He NEVER took well to advice. And by this point, ESPECIALLY from women. He had one of the strongest women for generations as a truthsayer and was passively happy she died. He was activly infuriated at female involvement at all by that point. It would have been a huge mark against her. He barely tolerated Pardot and Liet's visit shaped the Fremen course of action. A woman doing that would not have made it out alive, full stop.\n\n3) Warrick and the race for Faroula. The brother relationship would have been different between them. The sandstorm situation would have been different, I imagine a woman would literally strong arm a man into the shelter. The race wouldnt happened. I assume there would have been a decent chance they ended up together depending on if bloodlines changed. Liet wouldnt have run off for a few years.  The poison thing warrick went through to his death wouldn't have happened like it did. The way wives are adopted would have gone differently. They couldn't have had a child, which I know happens and she becomes important. Sure there are other ways but Liet would have had to carry, the whole prophet thing would have needed to follow a bloodline. I don't remember bisexuality within the Fremen being discussed but even if they had had a relationship, Faroula would have obligations to her new husband and if anything is drilled into us it's that Fremen will chose the good of the tribe over personal desire every single time. \n\n\n4) The massive emphasis on bloodlines. We all know how important Leto and Ghanima become and they carry the Keynes and Atreides bloodlines. Ain't no way the Bene Gesserit would have been passive about the atreides and prophet bloodline mix if Liet hadn't been biological. \n\nIt just doesn't jive, given tho the books are like 20% about the exact integrity of the atreides breeding. \n\nI'm thinking that, and I'm sure there are holes here, a great gender swap if they wanted it might be Duncan. There's no control of his bloodline. They can easily make women golas too. We could get Vin from the cosmere vibes.  Not that my eyes wanted to give up my aquaman screen time. They did redeem half of this in the scene with the baron stuck to the ceiling. I lost it. \n\nI'm super miserable, I got covid masked picking up groceries. And I have all these thoughts and no one to bounce them off. If some angel wants to indulge me it would make a sick girls day. \ud83d\ude02"

Now, it's clear that this is the case because he's some sort of Chosen One (or at least that's what the author wants us to think) but he also doesn't even have much of a personality? Seriously, every chapter he is in reads like some sort of young adult wish-fulfillment fanfiction. Is it going to be this way for the entire book series?\n\nDon't get me wrong, I am enjoying the book overall; but it's mostly for the excellent world-building, as well as the other characters. I just need to know if this aspect is going to improve. No major spoilers, please."

Much of Dune is about the importance of the ecology of Arrakis and its necessity, how the environment and animals work in tandem with each other. And how humans live off and try to survive in the harsh desert. I would LOVE it if they made a wild kingdom style fictional nature doc about Arrakis. Especially because of how fascinating it is to me how much work Frank Herbert put into the details of Arrakis's ecology. They should do it as promotional material for Dune Part II or even have it be this special feature on the blu-ray or something. I just think it'd be so cool and would love to watch an hours worth of a fake documentary on Arrakis and its animal & plant life. I love reading about Arrakis as a planet and it's environment but don't think we'll see much concerning the environmental aspects of Dune in Part II."

        "text": "As most of us know, the Steelbooks sold out almost immediately.\n\nSo, two weeks ago in the midst of a cold Canadian winter, one night it was so cold that I was driving my 2005 Mini Cooper and after a gear change I heard a loud knock and the car started sounding rough. It then shut off at a light and after a few minutes I got it to turn back one. Had to wait 2 weeks to get an appointment at the mechanic but this Tuesday I finally got one. The next day, I get a call from him saying that I needed to go to a dealership in a city half an hour away from me to pick up a part when it arrives in the next few days. Today I got a call from him saying that I had to go pick it up from the dealership, so I did.\n\nAll week, I had been searching for the steel book after missing the chance to get one early and missed a restock. I even called Best Buy a few times and it was quite literally wiped from their site. So After I was done at the dealership I looked for the nearest Best Buy because I had a hunch that maybe\u2026just maybe they\u2019d have it at the store. So I go and after getting passed around to a few different  employees, I get this lady who shows me the two versions they just had received in the back. Neither were the steelbook. She could tell I was disappointed so she looked at other stores, and nothing. Finally in a last ditch effort she says \u201cmaybe someone returned one? Let me check?\u201d. Sure enough, she goes and checks and lo and behold\u2026someone actually did return one (I know\u2026why would you do that) and it was sitting right there. Turns out that the person who returned it did so 20 minutes before I got there! On top of that, it does have a few dents so they also gave me 10% off!\n\nSo, by absolute fluke chance someone happened to return it and the timing just lining up so that the part for my car which broke down two weeks ago to come today, and me getting tied up at work so I couldn\u2019t go earlier\u2026I am now a proud owner of the steelbook version!\n\nBless the maker and his water."

Paul also mentions that there are Great Houses waiting to essentially grab the scraps. First off why is the Emperor suddenly appearing? The 2 prisoner Sardukar that Paul and the Fremen took were supposed to tell the Emperor they were bested to make him afraid but in the this chapter they are released when the Emperor arrives. Why are the Great Houses there? Because the Emperor said there will be a war against the Fremen? I\u2019m simply confused on the circumstances of the Emperors arrival. Wouldn\u2019t the Great Houses be worried to see the Emperor sending his Sardukar to a plane to wipe off the people. Sorry I\u2019m 16 and this book is somewhat difficult for me"

In the book it's clear that Hwi fell for Leto despite his physical appearance but do you guys think she was just doing what she was bred for or did she became something more than her Ixian masters intended? I personally think there's more to her and that she became her own person and I really like how Leto showed his humanity to Hwi and how Frank Herbert introduced her to the book and added a whole new perspective to it. I am not ready to move to Dune Heretics and Dune Chapterhouse yet, so let me know what you guys think! (no major spoilers for the next books , if there are any!)."

        "text": "I have to get this off my chest.  I just don\u2019t believe that Dune Messiah was written with the theme of questioning leaders.  The original Dune obviously has Campbell\u2019s Monomyth to a \u201cT,\u201d but then Dune Messiah and Children of Dune shoot that out of the sky\u2026.. but I am just refusing this.  I feel like Paul in Dune Messiah becomes a tragic hero, unable to commit to the golden path because his blood, lineage, timing, and context won\u2019t allow him, not because he just \u201cstarts to feel bad\u201d and becomes a bad leader.  I think he knows that he will die, and that his place is strictly to usher in his sons eventual metamorphosis.  He may not see or understand this fully, but he can put it together and he knows his actions and fate are to die once things are in motion\u2026. The oedipus cycle.  I speculate that he is aware of this eventuality and he knows that death, destruction, fanaticism, and the passing of Chani  is inevitable.  I don\u2019t think he was scared of altering his prescience, I think he knew he had to follow so that his sons actions would come as foreseen.  He submits to his fate, not trying to escape it. \nI just can\u2019t believe that Herbert\u2019s saga legitimately has the major theme that we should question leaders\u2026.. it\u2019s feels to shallow for me, and some of Pauls actions just don\u2019t line up with it.  He is a bridge to a greater arch, not just Paul but the family line.  Leto, Paul, Leto II.  Again, I can\u2019t believe that all this universe, all the books, all the articles\u2026\u2026 is for us to question leaders\u2026\u2026 like what is that!  It just feels like a shallow theme for something so deep, intriguing, and complex.  \nThoughts\u2026"

In the first book it was easy to see that a lot of the characterization is developed through the dialogue with (as far as I can tell) the series being very dialogue heavy since there\u2019s a million different characters and concepts to tackle. From the get go the second book is much better at this and much more to the point. \n\nIm loving how Herbert has turned dune completely on its head with the opposition of the jihad. Which makes sense. Ykno colonization is bad but it\u2019s like a mind fuck to have to be so sympathetic to the fremen from the start idk I just love this book \n\nAnyways I\u2019m going to get back to reading cause I\u2019m only like 65 pages into the book and I need to learn"

Don't get me wrong it's not the simple fact of the character being played as a woman that bothered me. It's that Liet was supposed to be Chani's father.\n\nIt just seemed like such a strange casting choice to make when most other things were faithful. Just totally bizarre.\n\nAny ideas why the producers would have changed the gender?"

        "text": "I\u2019m rereading the books, and am trying to make sense of the relatively scant backstory we get for Idaho throughout the series. According to Taraza in Heretics, he was born and raised on Giedi Prime. In God Emperor, he talks about climbing mountains to evade Harkonnen slave raiders as a child. God Emperor also mentions Idaho\u2019s sister being killed on Giedi Prime (I think FH was probably confusing Idaho with Gurney Halleck here, but I guess we can accept that they both lost sisters to the Harkonnens). In the first book, we learn that Duncan was trained by the Ginaz (allies of House Atreides), and fought Harkonnens on Grumman in the War of Assassins, where he first bloodied his sword (Ginaz was wiped out in this war, according to the appendices of the first book).\n\nAm I forgetting any pertinent details? I\u2019m only part ways into Heretics; I can\u2019t remember if any more details are mentioned later. I\u2019m primarily interested in the original six FH books.\n\nEDIT: He also says in Heretics that the Harkonnens tortured his mother, and he never saw her again."

As readers\/movie watchers, we\u2019re obviously privy to plot details that the characters themselves are not, but even if Shaddam\u2019s alliance with the Harkonen wasn\u2019t known or obvious to others, the fact that he did not attempt to hold them to count for their assault on Arrakis (which, to an outside observer, would or should be seen as a clear act of revolt against the Imperium) makes his intentions abundantly clear even to otherwise uninformed characters.  If Shaddam had (or at least believed he had) the fortitude to survive the political blowback from failing to hold the Harkonen publicly accountable for the attack, why wouldn\u2019t he have just sentenced Leto\/House Atreides to death and claim some conspiracy to overthrow him or the the like rather than the grand charade that was Arrakis?  It just seems so needlessly convoluted to me."

I\u2019ve started listening to the audiobook and watching heaps of awesome content on the fictional history and lore of the universe on YouTube and started think about the natural linkages the film has with other cinematic universes. \n\nThe key rules of the some 18,000 years from now are there are no known civilised alien species but are alien creatures. There was a history of AI and androids before the Great War resulting in their decimation. \n\nSo based off these rules I\u2019d suggest that the following could be in the same cinematic universe:\n- Blade Runner - AI, droids going haywire, off world colonies starting, no civilised alien species \n- Blade Runner 2049 - as per above\n- Alien - AI, droids, non civilised alien species (that were officially recorded and witnessed post Alien events), similar with xenomorphs \n- Aliens - above plus linkage with Blade Runner 2049 with USS Sulaco \n- Alien 3 - above\n- Alien Resurrection - above\n\nThoughts on above and any other cinematic universes that could fall under the above?"

After waking up and remembering possibly 1\/3rd of the film, I realized I\u2019d watched something beautiful and had to see it through to the end.  I watched it twice, literally in succession that afternoon.  The movie is brilliantly shot, but the story and characters are what really made it for me and I had to know more about this \u201cDune\u201d which I had possibly heard of before the film, but honestly thought was a video game adaptation or something.  \n\nI\u2019m not an avid reader\u2026 maybe read one to two books a year and they\u2019re generally along the lines of a Ludlum spy novel.  Since watching the Dune film I\u2019ve found myself on this thread and in the Dune wiki learning about the lore up to the point where the film ends.  It became clear that I needed to read these books so I picked up the set yesterday and I cannot put the first one down.  Part of the reason for writing this is I came across an article that basically said Dune is a chore to read.  I\u2019m only 200ish pages in so far, and it\u2019s been an absolute delight to read.

        "text": "So Dune 2021 was my first exposure to this universe (I know not a unique thing to say) and immediately sparked an interest in this universe so I immediately started watching lore videos and decided to read the first book (also nothing unique). Now I obviously had no expectations for the film's plot so I wasn't upset that anything was omitted, I wouldn't have even realised what was missing. But overall I think Denis did a great job keeping the most vital aspects, the only scene I thought really should have been there was Yueh talking about his wife, but I don't even think the dinner scene was that necessary for the plot of the film and would've padded out both the run time and blown up the budget (which means there would've been a bigger risk for this movie to be a failure). Now I've finished the first Dune book and I'm very excited to see what changes they'll make ,here's a few of my predictions.\n\n-The movie will start with Jamis' funeral and the water of life ritual merged (to save time) and that will give an explanation for why Alia is the way she is then we'll move to giedie prime and be introduced to Feyd and the Fenrings then there will be a 2 year jump back to arrakis\n\n-Alia won't be an actual baby, there will be some kinda explanation that the water of life sped up her physical and mental development so she could either be played by an extremely talented child actor who's between 5 and 7 or she could be played by a teenager and the water of life has caused her to be as wise as a Reverend mother, looks like a 12 year old but is 2. Idk just do something like the original Bioshock \n\n-I feel like Jamis' kids can be cut and his wife will have a minor role as a carer for Alia\n\n-The Barron and his nephew scheming to kill each other won't happen, in part 1 he doesn't seem to have agendas against Piter and Rabban like he does in the book\n\n-Hawat will be suspicious of Jessica's betrayal (which will happen during his service to the barron)but Gurney might not suspect her\n\n-Leto II might not be born, he doesn't really serve much purpose to the plot besides making Paul a father, the only thing we really learn about him is he has a lot of features of his grandfather and he's circumcised, his death doesn't really have much of an emotional punch, plus Alia being kidnapped is enough of an important event for the raid to occur and it actually leads to something. Plus I know there will be another Leto II\n\n-There might not be any tension hinting at a possible fight between Stilgar and Paul, I could see the movie abandoning this and still reaching a satisfying ending\n\n-Gurney will kill Rabban, unless I missed something they pretty much kill him off page, I thought it would be some satisfying duel between these two rivals and I think it's a no brainer for the film, while obviously Paul will fight Feyd at the end\n\n-Paul will have those visions of the guild ship being above arrakis and that'll obviously build up to the final attack but it'll only be the emperor's and Harkonnen's legions up there, the other houses being there make sense for the book but in a movie it makes sense for only the two armies the Fremen fight to be ready to land on arrakis\n\n-Alia killing the Barron will be the moment it's revealed that he's Jessica's father\n\n-The movie might end with some kinda ceremony, in the book Paul makes his demands then it kinda ends, I don't mind that but I could see it pissing off movie goers. It'll probably end in a way similar to Blade runner 2049 where it's a satisfying conclusion but some room for a sequel too\n\nThose are just a few predictions, if some don't make sense considering the context of what happens in later books forgive me I've only finished the first book and have just started Messiah. What are your predictions? I'm very excited for part 2 and seeing what others would like to see!"

I had heard that it was a little plodding and philosophical and I wasn't really in the head space after the sort of sci-fi action adventure that is the last few chapters of Children.\n\nThat being said the opening to God Emperor so far has been really good. I had heard over the years things about the plots of the various books after Dune and to be honest a lot of it sounded really dumb.  But it's a testament to Frank Herbert's writing I suppose that these plot elements don't seem dumb at all when you're actually reading them.  The whole this is really quite compelling.\n\nAnyway, just wanted to share since I'm already in the \"can't put it down\" phase and I'm only a few chapters in.\n\nCheers."

In \"The Machine Crusade\" specifically (I believe it was in the butlerian jihad book as well, but I just got to another description) it seems as if the dress and face covering Lady Jessica wears to arrakis is pretty much exactly what Serena Butlers guards wore and even her on occasion, but with different styles. It seems many women actually wore these fave coverings whether it be royalty or something similar throughout the books, but the gold specifically seems to be there. \n\nHas anyone else noticed this?

        "text": "I\u2019ve been meaning to read the books since the movie was announced but just never got around to it. I recently saw the movie and was blown away, it was fantastic and it was interesting to see how influential it has been other media, like the desert planet, sand worms and The Voice. \n\nI\u2019ve seen some comments on YouTube which have hinted at what\u2019s to come. I saw a comment that said that the \u201ctrilogy of Paul Atreides is a tragedy\u201d which, along with some of the darker visions in the film like the religious war vision, made me think he might not be a complete good guy. And indeed today I saw a comment mentioning he\u2019s not a hero. \n\nI don\u2019t feel bad for having read these things, I felt it was hinted at a bit in the movie, and it\u2019s actually made me very hyped to read the books. I know that if I don\u2019t do it soon I will spoil myself. \n\nLastly I want to mention the title of \u201cGod-Emperor\u201d. Of course it\u2019s a term that has been used in everyday language and I always thought it was a badass title. But I thought it was a literal god who was an Emperor, a chosen being with telekinetic powers or omnipotence something like this. But with the film only using the title \u201cEmperor\u201d I now believe the title to specifically refer to Paul Atreides, who will become a religious figure as seen in his vision and worshipped as a God, eventually taking the seat as Emperor. And somewhere along this journey he gets corrupted from being like his father, who valued lives more than spice and machinery, with the dream of restoring Arrakis, to something else. Hence the tragedy. God I\u2019m excited\n\nEdit: Also my favourite scenes in the movie were \u201cPain\u201d, the religiously important trees taking water, and the holy war vision. Also when Jessica unleashed her power"

I feel good about the support I\u2019ve given the title: saw in standard and IMAX in theatre, plus purchased for home viewing. I only give my money like that to works of art I truly care about.\n\nI want some thoughts on Jamis in the film. Paul has visions with Jamis in them before they meet, seemingly naming him as a friend.\n\nIs this an example of symbolism, meaning that Jamis would unknowingly act as a friend to Paul by being a sort of vessel that Paul uses to bond with the Freman? Or, is this simply a mixed-up vision, seeing as Paul\u2019s sight is rather new in nature. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s both? I don\u2019t recall any visions about Jamis before they meet in the book, so I\u2019m interested in how Villeneuve is portraying Jamis in this situation. Is it some deeper symbolism, or something more literal?"

I thought only a male could do this, and that was the power of the Kwisatz Haderach. Or do both males and females have access to the entirety of their genetic line and the power of the KH is the ability to resist possession more easily like Leto II can?  \n\n\nSorry if this is a dumb question, and if it's something that will be answered later in the book, just tell me that and I'll get there.   \n\n\nThanks in advance."

I want to learn everything there is about every nook and cranny, every people and person in the Dune universe - and, yes, it wouldn't have happened without the movie. I have tried to see the Lynch version several times, but I manage to about forty-five minutes in each time before I just turn it off. Life's too short for bad movies. I sensed a great story, but couldn't be arsed to start reading the books. Reading long books has been very difficult for me in my adult years, due to meds and mental illness - but after watching the recent movie, I bought the first audio book.     \n\nI can barely put it down (or, rather - pause it) once I start and I find that it does something very few fictional books have ever done - not even LoTR pierced that deep - it teaches me things. Other great works of fiction will teach you bravery and love and all that, and our culture is so saturated with such notions that they don't even register anymore. Instead, being a utilitarian, the child in me rejoices at finding out that the way I view resources has completely altered since I started listening. I live in the cold north, and water is obviously not a problem - but heat is. And with soaring electricity prices, so much so that the only real source of heat is firewood in a fireplace and your own body's heat trapped under layers upon layers of wool, it's easy to make very obvious comparisons. In the cold, everything is about preserving heat, creating heat, observing heat. Heat is money. Without it, nothing is possible - with it, everything is.     \n\n\nSo, yeah. Dune is pretty dope."

        "text": "So I'm into screenwriting in amateur level and few years ago, I wanted to make an adaptation to learn the script format. At that time, I've learned that Denis Villeneuve, which I've known by Arrival, is making an adaptation of Dune. I've immediately bought the book and quickly finished it. It was so awesome that I've decided to write my own version for the Part 1 before the movie comes out.\n\nI managed to write 60 minute pages long script, that is equivalent to approximately 1 hour of the movie, ended where the House Atreides landed on Arrakis. It was a mediocre script, but it gave me an insight about writing.\n\nNow I want to do the same for Part 2 until the second part of the movie comes out. Part 2, I think, has more fun, yet since it involves more dense plots and time jumps etc. it's more complex to get it right. \n\nSo I have some ideas that I obsessed with for some scenes, but it still has many problems, so I wanted to consult the community. Below I will write what I am trying to do and what I could come up with until now. \n\nBy the way I've read Dune 1 and Messiah.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n* I start the script from the point where the first movie ends, so it's like I'm writing a Fan Fiction Part 2 without actually ignoring the DV adaptation.\n\n------->>> Where I am stucked is that:\n\nWe know that Paul is a genius strategist and a Mentat. He also has this prescient ability making him superior and bringing him victory.\n\nIn a warrior tribe, everyone respects the one who brings victory. Before Paul became the prophet through the Missionaria and Spice Orgy, I want to describe him as a leader who brought victory to the Fremen with his strategy ability. I would like to convey in advance that he is not a leader by only fulfilling the predetermined signs, but also he has the potential to deserve the title of leadership. I mean, he can really rule these people and can give them their freedom. Fremen will believe that before the Missionaria Protectiva signs. Like Lawrence of Arabia, after a succeed raid, the Fremen warriors will shout his name and gather around him. It can be a great way to show Lisan al Gaib Prophecy. (What will lead to the Jihad will still be this religious prophecy and Bene Gesserit manipulations of course.) \n\n* That's why I think Paul must organize a raid that unite the Fremen under his leadership before the spice orgy. And the excuse for this unity will be Liet Kynes. (In Dune Messiah, one of the Fedaykin commanders Farok says that everyone were believing Paul was blessed by Kynes. \"Paul was chosen by Kynes to make Arrakis a paradise.\") \n\nBut if I do that, to go to the battle, Paul will leave from Sietch Tabr and will have left his mother Jessica behind. And according to the Map of Arrakis, she will be far from Paul for at least 2 days, since the nearest Harkonnen camp location would be maybe in Hagga Basin and going there will take approximately 1 night and 1 day by worm.\n\nThat's a very long time. What will Jessica do in Sietch Tabr alone? She will of course be very anxious about sending her son to the war, remember that she had a panic attack during the Gom Jabbar test. \n\nThen I decided to give her a little story arc with old, ill Fremen Reverend Mother Ramallo and her Sisterhood. Jessica could further manipulate these people and maybe scare them by some Bene Gesserit tricks. Also here, she can say her prayer in the book. Remember in the book, she says a special prayer when she was with Stilgar. \n\nTherefore, she is gradually becoming a Weirding Woman, a Saint. Meanwhile, Ramallo's illness is progressing. Ramallo chooses Jessica to replace her. Because Jessica is a Saint Sayyidina, she is the best option. \n\nThen the next day, Paul arrives to Sietch Tabr with other Fremen warriors. People say that he is really the One etc. \n\nThen that night Spice Orgy will happens. \n\nAfter the Orgy, during those visions, 2 year Time Jump starts. \n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI'm really confused. I want Paul to have a small battle that will make him stand out for his strategic ability. Not just for the action, but because I see it as a necessary narrative element. But I couldn't find a way to tell the story clearly. In this way, it seems that the story will progress too slow. I want to hear your thoughts on this if you are interested. \n\nIf you have any idea, please do not hesitate to discuss. \n\nThanks in advance."

        "text": "An interesting passage:\n\n*\u201cThe end adjusts the path behind it. Just once I failed to fight for my principles. Just once. I accepted the Mahdinate. I did it for Chani, but **it made me a bad leader.**\u201d*\n\nThe Mahdinate... So he tried to extend Chani\u2019s life in turn prolonging the Jihad? At one point in Messiah he weighed her one life against the greater suffering of the Jihad:\n\n*\u201cI\u2019ve loitered, he thought. And he saw how he\u2019d been hemmed in by boundaries of love and the Jihad. And what was one life, no matter how beloved, against all the lives the Jihad was certain to take? Could single misery be weighed against the agony of multitudes?\u201d*\n\nIt\u2019s stated the alternative to her death in the Sietch would have been to be held hostage along with her children in slave pits, reviled with the blame of Paul\u2019s death. But it\u2019s also suggested this path would destroy his enemies:\n\n*\u201cThere was no other way. Chani, beloved, believe me that this death was quicker for you \u2026 and kinder. They\u2019d have held our children hostage, displayed you in a cage and slave pits, reviled you with the blame for my death. This way \u2026 this way we destroy them and save our children.\u201d*\n\nSomeone recognized that accepting the Mahdinate for Chani\u2019s sake instead of the Golden Path is a contradiction. An also contradiction is that he could\u2019ve run away with her damn all universe, it was there for him if he really put Chani above the rest of all life. So the idea of the quote to me therefore: \u201cI accepted the Mahdinate. *But I expended my powers for the best of Chani\u2019s sake.* It made me a bad leader.\u201d The simplest reading to my understanding is that he valued Chani\u2019s life too much, which makes thematic sense because Love as a weakness (and conversely strength) has incredible relevance to so many of our characters.\n\nMy perception of Paul has been warped so hard by the myth that he was too much of a coward to carry out the Golden Path that he let his son succumb to it. Paul hadn\u2019t the breadth of vision to see the Golden Path hedged the entirety of human survival. He believed there was another way, of course Leto II revealed there in fact wasn\u2019t. Then he ceded, he got to understand in the end. Paul did the absolute best he could given the circumstances, and then some. Through semi-prioritizing his family he saved his childrens\u2019 lives and minimized Chani\u2019s awful fate. You could argue that *that* was the best play possible. If Leto had been up to his neck inside a cage instead of his place borne as grand heir to the throne he wouldn\u2019t have been able to command authority and perform the Golden Path in the first place. And this is ignoring Paul was already depressed from grieving Chani\u2019s death and being perpetually dead himself from being caught in the trap of prescience.\n\nThe most confusing line (and the one that stuck with me the most) was the odd quote I put above. The Atreides principle denotes selfless servitude to the people. The Atreides lived in the service of the people they governed. Did Paul, in his consuming love for Chani, forsake that at some point? \n\nOr does it go back even further? Before the Mahdinate, people might argue the Jihad and the consequences of his godhead were a result of his selfish desire to destroy the Harkonnens out of revenge. Personally I don\u2019t think he possessed the full extent of Oracle to see its farther reaching terrors. Paul had both an obligation to liberate the Fremen and avenge his father. He seemed genuinely convinced that to avoid the Jihad, he needed to see the future through, and it wasn\u2019t until his confrontation with Feyd that he realized that at that point it was too late: he\u2019d coached the Fremen in the Atreides battle tactics, gave them complete control over the Guild, and the legend would persist. The best course of action would have been to get killed by Jamis but then how could he have possibly known that? This dimension to the story really emphasizes the tragedy of his savior complex, and comparisons have been made to actual Greek tragedies but this feels especially brutal for Paul.\n\nYour thoughts?"

Seeing Dune on the Big Screen with Dolby sound was one of the best movie experiences of my life. The only things I can remember being on that level are LotR: The Two Towers, LotR: Return of the King, and 1917.\n\nI decided to go see it a second time but it was already out of theaters. Not being able to ever experience Dune the way it should be had me pretty disappointed. The score is amazing. Feeling the thumpers in your chest is amazing. Everything is amazing.\n\nSo I decided to buy a surround sound system. Originally budgeted for ~$500 but ended up spending $700 on a subwoofer alone (thanks to r\/hometheater). I got everything set up last week and have been waiting for the blue ray to drop 1\/11\/2022 to finally get to watch it again. Below is a link to a picture of my setup for tomorrow. \n\nhttps:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/hvhGFnBx\/FD3-D7-EB4-B602-4-AF5-8-FEF-5-C00-A2-E639-AD.jpg"

These Museum Fremen imitate the Fremen traditions, but poorly\u2014they are wasteful with water, they forget the purpose of their rituals, and even the definitive ideals and physical qualities of Fremen culture seem lost in their imitators.\n\nYou might call the Museum Fremen 'performative', although I hesitate to use that term in real-life applications as it does have a denigrating connotation that ignores the historical context of a culture's transformation\u2014although Frank Herbert doesn't exactly disguise his criticism of this quality in the Museum Fremen, essentially treating them as pathetic and a poor, mock imitation of the 'true' Fremen culture.\n\nSetting aside the implied criticism in the culture of the Museum Fremen (and I truly mean no condemnation in suggesting these parallels), for a real-world analogue we might look to the status of indigenous peoples in the modern-day United States of America. I hope not to offend\u2014and I believe I'm echoing the plight of conservationists within their own culture\u2014in noting the similar loss of historical context related to the traditions of many indigenous cultures. Through cultural institutions, languages are taught, rituals performed, dress worn etc. in an attempt to conserve the history of their culture moreso than out of the original utilitarian or religious purposes of those traditions. The forced migration to reservations is another clear parallel between the two cultures.\n\nNow to my questions:\n\n1. Is there a term in historical analysis, cultural anthropology, conservationism, or even ecology, for this sort of evolution of a culture to a pseudo-culture?\n2. Is there a term for the effect of artificial\/intentional conservation on the subjects being conserved in regard to their culture or biology, possibly even specifically relating to the place of the reservation or subjugated cultures in cultural anthropology?\n3. Does anyone have suggestions for further discussion or research of these concepts in Dune or otherwise?\n\nSorry for the long preamble, but I appreciate any input and welcome further discussion on these concepts academically or in relation to Frank Herberts views, how I've posited them, or their place in the story & universe of Dune."

So when I heard that the following dune books where more focused on philosophy, narrative and characters I thought I would love it, since that's what I liked so much in the first book.\n\nProblem was, while it does focus on these aspects, it didn't feel as well executed as in Dune.\n\n I felt the first book was just brilliant in the way it describes events that are just grand and involve a human brain having to deal with space and time, like when Paul first experience his prescience, or when Alia awakens in her mother's womb. You can't understand 100% what is happening, and you shouldn't, because these are things beyond human comprehension, it's intentional, adds scope and it's brilliant. I didn't get the same feeling from messiah, that sort of mistery and awe from being exposed to things just beyond your comprehension, if anything, the whole thing felt cryptic and overly complicated.\n\nThe second thing I didn't like were the dialogues, those were the best parts in Dune, a conversation between lady Jessica and any other character had the stakes as high as any major battle, with every character trying to read each other's intentions, break defenses and waiting to attack, just genius.  For a book whose plot revolves around a conspiracy, Messiah felt very toned down in comparison. \n\nAnyways, I am still going to read children of dune, specially because I have read some things about God emperor that have made me really curious to check that book."

Are they reinforced with armor and air, and if so, do they develop their own weapons?(I understand that orbital bombardment may count as air support, but I was thinking along the line of dedicated bombers). Do they build their own ships? How independently can they rule their planet in regards to the emperor? Does the emperor give out tasks and planets for houses to conquer?

If you\u2019re an enthusiast, almost all the shows have turned the loyal into furious masses, brandishing pitchforks & burning effigies while shouting witchcraft. \n\nDune nailed it. It isn\u2019t perfectly aligned with the books. No adaptation should be. It\u2019s ok for the writers and producers to take liberty to make the best screen version to balance the attraction of the masses while retaining the loyal base. But the spirit and characters are grounded in the Dune legendarium. \n\nIf any of the cast or staff of Dune monitor this sub, thank you. If any of the writing staff of WoT or Witcher are here, FFS take a lesson from Villaneuve et al."

It\u2019s incredible, but it\u2019s far from the traditional orchestral score you usually get with these types of films. Which I think fits Dune very well. I really wouldn\u2019t want a Dune score that sounds like Williams, Giacchino, or Desplat. Those sounds feel quite antithetical to the tone and atmosphere of Dune. \n\nWhen Paul and Jessica get into their stillsuits and go into the deep desert to find the Fremen, there\u2019s this great moment where they look out into the desert and there\u2019s this incredible panning wide shot, and for maybe the first time in the film, the music isn\u2019t being used to create tension, but rather it\u2019s accentuating the beauty of Arrakis, and it sounds welcoming. The track is called \u201cStillsuits\u201d on the score. Despite all we know about the dangers of the desert, and the terrible things the characters have been through, there\u2019s this strange optimism, and it feels like the desert is inviting Paul to go deeper. He is no longer on the run, but instead he\u2019s heading towards his new home."

        "text": "Here we go!\n\nEverything in this book gives some sort of immense feeling. Even the first words to appear present a sense of gigantic scale: \"A begining is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct\". Why would someone be interested in studying the life of this Muad'Dib and why is a Princess writing about him? This chapter has a lot to unpack, but I'll write my thoughts on two things. I look forward to read yours!\n\nI found interesting that Paul's introduction included a meditation in which human perceptions are distinguished from animal sensations. Humans are special in this universe, with a capacity to go beyond the physical side of things. \"The human requires a background grid through which to see his universe\". Humans, or at least certain humans, can achieve some capabilities beyond what the senses can produce. They control their bodies by using meditation techniques (like the Litany against Fear), they perceive details in utterances that to find the reasons behind the words (like the instinct for rightness) and they an incredible ability to observe. Human abilities have grown beyond what we are capable of doing. The schools that have nurtured those abilities seem to be a central part of this universe.\n\nThat takes me another aspect that I found the chapter insisted on: Hierarchy. From the way Paul protests the Reverend Mother's treatment of Jessica, to the comment about the Fremen not being part of the class system in the Imperium. The order in which the universe is governed is presented like a rigid structure, Arrakis being a rare case of being outside said order. Also the Bene Gesserit have a special place in this hierarchy, being able to command how a Duke is to reproduce and even to be able to kill the offsprings they don't find suitable. I find this interesting because Paul is the result of Jessica disobeying this order and the chapter givessome hints of him disagreeing with the Revered Mother.\n\nSo yeah, some sort of superhuman beings are pulling the strings of the universe. Their purpose is to be seen and next week we'll take a deeper look into Arrakis. Thank you for your atention, and sorry for any mistakes.\n\n\n\nSupplements:\n\nHere Denis Vileneuve talks about the Gom Jabbar scene in the 2021 movie: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GoAA0sYkLI0\n\nu\/Cool_Formal2491 pointed out the Gom Jabbar podcast has a book club series here: https:\/\/loreparty.com\/gomjabbar\n\nhttps:\/\/dune.fandom.com\/wiki\/Dune_Wiki"

        "text": "I've been loving my first read through of the series so far, and just shy of halfway into Heretics I realized why I think I like this one better than almost all the earlier books in the series (except OG Dune).\n\nEarlier Dune books, especially Children and God Emperor, were chock full of chapters that were very introspective and internal-monolog heavy. Now I loved a lot of these chapters and they were the backbone of those books. But the issue was that while it was going on, rarely was much else happening around the characters. I mean how many chapters were just Leto rambling to Moneo in a crypt in God Emporer?\n\nIn Heretics, here we have an introspective chapter of a reverend mother waiting for Sheeana to come.  She's just chilling watching over the bazaar, internalizing a bunch of thoughts in that typical Dune fashion, but she's also people watching.  She watches a dance break out, a local ritual involving nude men and potentially a little scuffle later.  She watches the locals gather and start engaging with the dancers.  She sees Sheeana's guard detail start marching in, uncaring about anything going on around them. The dancers knock over a fruit cart and are dancing in the fruit pulp. The tempo of the dancers and crowd quicken. Guards are pushing forward. Things are getting thrown. The tempo quickens. People are fighting. The guard continues to march through the melee without even a sideways glance. The dancers are swept into the brawl. Its blood and gore and mayhem. Sheeana comes into the temple. Blood and bodies everywhere down below. End chapter.\n\nUltimately its a chapter where nothing plot wise really happens and is a reverend mother just reflecting on who she is in this place and what this place is. But instead of being slow and monolog heavy, its rich with this outside world and their traditions, chaos and this tempo that keeps ramping and ramping to almost a crescendo.  Somehow Frank's writing just seems to get better and better from book to book.\n\nThank you for coming to my Ted Talk."

I felt it was a little too long and some of the philosophical digressions were not as interesting as the others. Leto\u2019s transformation was strange and exciting even though I was spoiled that he becomes a worm of some kind.\n\nHad a few questions about the book -\n- How did Ghanima avoid becoming an Abomination? Did Paul and Harum help her too?\n- What is Leto\u2019s Golden Path? He says he wants to bring peace to the universe, but also says it\u2019ll be far worse than Paul\u2019s rule. I\u2019m very confused by the specifics of his proposed rule. Wish he spoke less ambiguously, but I also love this indirectness in Frank\u2019s writing in most places.\n- Why did Leto have to marry Ghanima in the end?\n- Why was Paul even necessary to this story?\n- Why did Paul have to die in the end?\n- Is Leto\u2019s sacrifice that he no longer can be human and have a penis? I don\u2019t fully understand Ghanima\u2019s line about Leto _running in the night_ to get tired.\n- Why couldn\u2019t Ghanima become a sandworm too and live for thousands of years?\n\nI really loved the direction Frank took the characters of Alia, Jessica, Stil and the twins in this book. Didn\u2019t like or see the point of Paul at all. Didn\u2019t really love the idea of making Leto Superman in the end. I always thought that the worm transition would be for some higher intellectual capacity. The fact that it ended up being just brute strength and speed was meh (maybe I should think more about it).\n\n\nI\u2019m going to give Dune a break and come back for GEOD in a few weeks. This community has been great and very welcoming, so thanks for that! Be _awesome_.\n\nUpdate: \nAlso, how is this book even science fiction? It\u2019s pretty much fantasy with the plot heavily relying on genetic ancestral consciousness and a human transforming into a worm. Not saying the book has to be sci-fi for it to be enjoyable, but want to hear how people classify this book in general."

Moving pictures in general is a very visual medium. \nThe audience doesn't like to be told what's going on and why, they want to see it happening and deduce for themselves what it all meant.\nWe cringe at the infamous Irulan's introduction in 1984 film with her long exposition speech, and Paul constantly whispering his thoughts but then imagine for a second how would YOU adapt Dune as a movie. \nIf i were to summarize the entirety of Dune saga without giving away any spoilers, I'd say it's a story that mostly consists of dialogues in which very smart people plot against each other. \nThey act a certain way on purpose, to make the opponent think they are planning to do one thing while in their mind they are going over their real plan. Wheels within wheels, neverending game of 4D chess. \nSo the actual visual aspect of the story often contradicts the reality within character's minds. We can see their thoughts while reading, but how can a movie show that without whispering in a microphone or running some kind of mental subtitles? \n\nI hear sometimes that the new Dune movie is not as deep and complex as the story, but come on, man! How can you possibly film that? \n\nPlaying these subtle clues well would require hiring a band of face dancers for the acting crew and Bene Gesserit sitting in the audience to pick up on those clues."

Long story short, I have a message from the deep about particular part of DUNE story that can be revealed in next Villeneuve's films, and I want to suggest Julio Cesar Cedillo on role of Fedaykin lieutenant Otheym. Because he\u2019s such a badass and cutie, and the character fits him so well, and I\u2019ve already made some illustrations based on Frank Herbert's books. And I\u2019m going to tell the SPOILERS!!\n\nYou might have already seen Julio Cedillo as \"final boss\" in Denis Villeneuve's film Sicario (2015)\n\n[Salud](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8uys5t4kbha81.jpg?width=4026&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=332cb23098300552d6db625c20e354025b6d40b1)\n\nIn DUNE(2021) were many fine actors from Villeneuve's previous films. And I can't stop thinking about how awesome it would be if my favorite actor took part in Part Two.\n\nThe feeling begin when I saw Duncan Idaho in the new film - I thought, yes, here can be seen Villeneuve was inspired by Master Yupa from Nausicaa, a wonderful plot structure! So pity that it works only on words. The Aguaman moves so repulsively, like he was a soulless zombie - Ghola from the beginning ... (this is the only critique for the film, everything else is brilliant)\n\nI know who could play this knight really touching ... but if HE died at the very beginning (and the further events of the film were not devoted to how he is buried three times) I would just cry until the end of the film and even Shai-Hulud could not distract my attention.   \nPlus, remembering that Idaho is supposed to return as kinda Necris, with Julio it would be too much like helicopter pilot from The Walking Dead.So screw Idaho. All the fun is ahead.\n\nFor most of the film, I was completely in sync with Paul: while he was hallucinating with visions of Chani, I (without any psychoactive substances, but with similar mechanics) was thinking about big wild freman warrior who would arrive from afar on a giant sandworm and show a weird fighting technique based on distorting the very reality and will also reveal the cozy elements of the local lifestyle as well as the dreams of turning the part of Arrakis into green oasis.   \nI wondered if he was a particular character in the book, or I came up with him, recalling separate elements of the lore that fit to adapt for Julio. Because I read this a very long time ago, when I was so little, and everything managed to mix and blur.   \nAttempts to remember the future ... Funny?   \nAfter returning from the movie theater, I read the first book in a couple of days, and, having restored the missing fragments, was surprised how clearly Otheym met my expectations.\n\nThis character's presence is noted in the midst of the most expressive story episodes, but his role is clearly not for book storytelling, he does not speak alot, he does not have a separate descriptions for thoughts, because Otheym is above deceit... mostly... I know with Julio can be added funny improvised bluff to deceive the enemies during combat!Otheym is more suitable for visual action and his short expressions can have tremendous depth when presented with proper tone of voice and modified ethnic accent, but Frank Herbert did not prescribe it too much, because Julio was not even born at that time to inspire. ;)   \nSo the books contain only key points about Otheym and remind a film script in these moments.\n\n[ Time for a nice relaxing sandworm ride  ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/61cnamskdha81.jpg?width=3508&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=26b9e45708013d5977a6c59a7f6ba7f2da885ee9)\n\nAnd here's the first illustration, painted in watercolor: incredibly expensive technique by measures of Dune setting! Usul can now count on support more powerful than whole army of sardaukars. I equipped Otheym with a long sword-tooth of a living worm, which, however, he most likely will not use in most cases: it seems more convenient for him to rip and tear with bare hands like Doomguy, using the surrounding surfaces and dismembered parts of the enemies. He can also use riding hooks on humans as a very brutal version of lasso, or in style of Kabal from MK on short distances.\n\nThe book mentions that he has a unique part of outfit - camouflage - without much detail in the description. In my vision it should be a hybrid technology of thermo-optical camouflage and super-cozy poncho with ethnic patterns....or maybe it's not termo-optical and Otheym is just a smartass who has a collection of super-cozy cloaks for all situations. \u2013 yes, this suggestion fits canon, since his wives are good weavers.\n\nWhile doing this one i recalled the song Vingene Mine by Anja Garbarek. I tried to find the right song for each illustration, because this story longs for songs! Why Gurney hasn't played on his damn baliset in the film?!\n\n[ Muaddib for lunch ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/sn5jmu45eha81.jpg?width=3508&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a045394e9f0b4d3bb4199dacabad5df485a98493)\n\nThis comic improvisation was made with Stephane Picq's soundtrack for the Dune quest from Cryo. I wanted to portray the Fedaykin sneaking, like a panther...   \nTo break another Harkonnen's neck?   \nNo, it's too easy\u2026 any fool can kill a man! I need to show a real mastery level. Not everyone has enough cunning and dexterity to catch a kangaroo mouse. It\u2019s probably good that Paul didn\u2019t get on duel with This One, otherwise the Atreides story would have ended pretty fast.\n\n[ Smugglers on Fremen territory ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/nx1xztkseha81.jpg?width=3508&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7d19f66431ee931ab35ee4d3859b417a9d729639)\n\nThe scene of reunion with Gurney. Gurney is smiling... well, I think so.   \nI feel like I did the illustration for the song Wish You Were Here by Pink Floyd.   \nThe \"main\" characters' talks would serve a good background.   \nOtheym went a little too far? Maybe This One turned out to be attentive enough and foresaw who should not be allowed into Cave of Birds.\n\nHere is outlined a favorable way to present Otheym in the film in accordance with his role in the book, at first as an unnamed Elite Fedaykin, while his face is hidden by mask: he will stand out from the rest with a larger model and unique elements of outfit (should work with a similar principle as why models of story characters in WOW are usually 30% larger than players)\n\nA very convenient moment regarding the adaptation of the character in the film is flexible timing: Otheym can be shown for just a few minutes like Boba Fett in Episode Five, or he can have a lead role in personal series, or even better to make him the protagonist of the game with whom you won't want to part even after a thousand hours. (the best is to make all things seriatim)\n\nIn any case, the viewer will pay attention to him, remember his voice, gait, posture, hands and other characteristic expressive details, Julio Cedillo has a huge arsenal of which. Thanks to bright cloaks, he can be immediately identified even in the thick of battle, or it will make a long time to find him, peering into the picturesque textures of the landscape. For some time he can create intrigue (or fanservice for those who are already acquainted with Julio \\^\\_\\^) So at the moment when he first appears in the book as the character with name and face, he will in any case be greeted as well-known, in accordance with described Chani\u2019s perception:\n\n[ Otheym meets Chani at Cave of Birds ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/cswnmri0gha81.jpg?width=3508&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0f2baf29a993fba4e05158ab3ac77bbf1772aec3)\n\n*A great figure loomed out of the rocks above her, beckoning for speed. She quickened her pace. Dawn birds already were calling and lifting into the sky. A dim spread of light grew across the eastern horizon. The figure above was not one of her own escort. Otheym? she wondered, marking a familiarity of movement and manner. She came up to him, recognized in the growing light the broad, flat features of the Fedaykin lieutenant, his hood open and mouth filter loosely fastened the way one did sometimes when venturing out on the desert for only a moment.\"Hurry,\" he hissed, and led her down the secret crevasse into the hidden cave. \"It will be light soon,\" he whispered as he held a doorseal open for her. \"The Harkonnens have been making desperation patrols over some of this region. We dare not chance discovery now.\"* \\- Dune (1965)\n\nI\u2019d add that This One has a special relationship with birds. I think he tamed them by sharing water from his stillsuit.\n\n[Otheym witnesses the awakening of Lisan al Gaib](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/d9vqcm65hha81.jpg?width=4110&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5267971c855e79b2ce8c51e3b2d5d87c35bea498)\n\nThis composition was made with Peter Gabriel's San Jacinto, since the song describes similar ritual trial. Jolly things can be done with this scene, for example naive viewers who haven't read the book can momentarily be made to think something like \"Oh, he played bad guys in some good movies, how suspicious he is getting so much attention. What causes this sly expression on his face? Maybe he is the villain who poisoned Paul Muaddib?\"\n\nSpoiler: He\u2019s a best friend till the end, who deserves a personal videogame spin-off in genre of something in between 'SW:Republic Commando' and 'Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead'.\n\nSomeone should've caught and drown a fresh little worm for Usul, as well as tell the disclaimers to reveal lore elements.   \nI think Otheym himself can drink \"the water of life\" to... \"swap skillpoints\".The experience of all the previous Julio Cedillo's characters will be a huge advantage for survival on Arrakis: for example, cowboy skills will help masterly control Shai-Huluds, cartel bosses and cops will give a bonus to tricks and warn about the dangers of the spice trade, one of multiverse-ancestors even used Prana-Bindu to ignore energy shields with sniper rifle, and the Last Aztec Emperor can add thrilling beauty of storytelling in Magical Realism genre.\n\nWhat? Did you think little Sand-Mouse-Shadow-In-The-Second-Moon is the only human male who can do that? Kwisatz Haderach is the pinnacle of human selection program. Which does not usually take the right course: think of leopard geckos with enigma syndrome and other victims of merciless inbreeding. Perhaps this is an even greater crime against nature than thinking machines. I want to show a character who personifies the opposite path: natural evolution and harmonious adaptation. To emphasize the importance of the \"Secret Ingredient\" without which is impossible to create any good Chosen One.\n\nDoes anyone remember the name of the big moon with five claws that rises first in the night?\n\n[ Eat the worm fedaykin ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/dylfhx2liha81.jpg?width=3508&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d4ce7998e21011acd33ac5c852b514eec3ffa163)\n\nTleilaxu sunrise, ibad eyes\n\nRealize we're all born to die\n\nSo get the melange naib!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Otheym turns Holtzman shield into microwave oven](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/fq8q1o4yiha81.jpg?width=3502&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=79ed19219e3f22d77561c4d9399d8c23cf0325e1)\n\nThe Weirding Way technique doesn't seem allowing fedaykin to move any faster, it rather makes slower all the Known Universe around the performer. Thus, fedaykin can easily ignore energy shields, or turn their effect against the inner subject to make picturesque fatality. It must seem really weird to an outside observer: the fremen commando teleports and sardaukar head explodes.\n\nNI\u0418 - The Perfect Drug - this song perfectly describes the last moments of poor sardaukar caught in death clutch. I think Otheym can paralyze his victims using The Charisma of Julio Cedillo: it's like The Voice of Bene Gesserit, only instead of unconsciousness it gives the subject unforgettable rapture.\n\nOh, I can imagine what a scandal will be if Otheym\u2019s wives find out that this idiot did his stupid magic tricks again! Vibration of the energy shield resistance can cause multiple microtraumas that lead to arthritis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Otheym protects Usul ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/j02r19yikha81.jpg?width=3498&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=283239ec080727f058919dcbad9139efd68b6d4d)\n\nStarted the sketch with MGMT - Kids, and then imagined how it may sound in Mick Gordon's cover. Illustration, which was conceived as the most frivolous and comical in series, eventually turned out to be looking like the most brutal and surious.\n\nI just wanted to make fun of film scene where Paul was drooling while watching the vision of upcoming battle... I don\u2019t think that in real time it will be so glamorous and resembling the Power Rangers. Real sardaukars won't wait until the boy finishes dancing and posing. Otheym must show how to clean a pack in one move and methodically deal with the rest.\n\n[ Otheym the Conqueror ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/414ecai5lha81.jpg?width=2458&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4f053c91a01c10e827772b6008596003e33cb6e7)\n\nWhat the best Hunter of Arrakis is gonna do when he gets to other planets? He'll try out local fauna of course! I made this illustration as an example of what can be captured on photos that Paul has seen in Otheym's house while he still had eyes.\n\nBy the way, the fact (in book Dune Messiah) that Otheym has a photo gallery makes him even more akin to Julio Cedillo, since in addition to acting and screenplay editing; he is also a keen photographer who usually provides films with wonderful additional materials and cool stories.\n\n[Otheym hands over Bijaz](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4svdwiu1mha81.jpg?width=4128&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=181638ddaddd8b70a3b5193aa07d055a2bbde6b1)\n\nI was making this illustration with Tim Larkin's soundtrack to Myst Age Todelmer, because the planet where Otheym caught his splitting disease (resembles the impact of metaphysical anomaly) was named somehow similar, that caused direct associations. Had to dry out my protagonist to Mordecai's condition to match mournful description of the last documented scene with him. I consider the image of emaciated Julio as a symbol of deepest sci-fi horror that cannot be fully revealed for human comprehension. Stoneburner seems rather a part of escape plan.\n\nIt feels like something like a whole Red Dead Redemption2 happened behind the scenes of the Base story. Even quite bigger, because Otheym's travel is interplanetary.\n\nIs it necessary mentioning that Julio Cedillo has a mastery of playing sufferers?   \nI think this scene can be like 'Manos de Oro' on hardmode:   \nDespite his severe physical condition, Otheym still organizes stealth operations, and even Padishah Emperor of the Known Universe himself, immediately came to Otheym's unassuming suburban house at first call.\n\nAfter Sicario I could imagine Dhuri only like Lora Martinez-Cunningham with Ibad eyes and load of water rings: extended sci-fi version of Faust Alarcon's wife. She understands the dangers of her husband's work and, even when he's obviously doomed, stays with him until the end. (Nothing like in the original Sicario script, that was used mostly to cut for memes. lol)   \nThis is a good way to show through metafiction, without wasting time on words, the construction that Dhuri is not the first wife of Otheym, but looks very same, since they were sisters, and also look like her sister's daughter, but with eldering makeup and different dress. At first I thought to draw her more disheveled like raider lady from Book of Eli, but such hairstyle fitted Dhuri more in times when they lived happy in sietch with birds. By the way, she lied. The tribe won't get a single drop of Otheym's water! BOOM! HAHAHAHAHA!!\n\nAnd to make it even more entertaining for him to play the sufferer, I decided to introduce Walton Goggins as Bijaz! This is the one who can surreally play a key role in the most unpredictable circumstances! (The actor does not have to be a real dwarf, because i imagined how Tleilaxu created this psychedelic creature piece by piece, like replicants in Blade Runner.) By the way, Bijaz's special ability is literal immunity to prescience. Otheym, on the contrary, symbolizes constancy, and his every word sounds like the fulfillment of a heroic prophecy. These two have glorious character chemistry. Can you feel how many flashbacks flashed between Otheym's words \"I bought him on a world...\" and \"...I forget\"..? Of course, he panicked and said nonsense. There was no time to tell about their adventures to Usul. Maybe the \u00absplitting disease\u00bb was caused, because the one who personified the Constant, fearlessly bended the course of events in his own will. The walking Nexus of events! Such motif can be easily demonstrated in game narrative with choices between multiple outcomes each of which would be equally relevant in context of the Base story, but bringing completely different moralities, emotions and interpretations.\n\n[ Otheym's secret ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ibeakvktnha81.jpg?width=2446&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b364b1cfa6295220738e1ee9b6c0ff693ab83df1)\n\nThese little cliff racers on taste like green bananas. And biologically they rather more fruits than animals. They are not mentioned in any Dune book because I invented them specifically for this version of Otheym and Lichna.\n\nSeriously, Lichna is not going to die. The sequel book is intentionally abstract about this point. First of all, Otheym would never entrusted his daughter's life to this prescient addicted Emperor(of subjectively known universe) Muad'dib Atreides! The open desert with Shaihulud is much safer for young fremen lady than some royal palace swarming with conspiracies and constant murder attempts. And Tleilaxu rather prefer a fair bargain, than senseless violence. Scytale the Face Dancer seems very interesting creature; helping with the rehearsal of his play would be great activity for Lichna to distract herself and cope with semuta problem. And as for the unidentified body, obviously left on purpose to push on the Emperor's conscience: it can be anything, maybe some biomaterial left on the bottom of the acid vat.\n\nWant to dismantle an empire? Trust This One!\n\nI'm your sequel franchise spinoffed! AHAHAHAHA!!!\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/vd3xr94doha81.jpg?width=1406&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=624a59048cf828b9df011a741c900e7e4c3c3fb7\n\nI have so many more ideas and sketches for illustrating Otheym\u2019s adventures, but I had to show what\u2019s ready for now, because the time when decisions are made feels close.\n\nIf you have any ideas how to share this dream to Villeneuve, it will be very much appreciated."

However, what seems most obvious to me is that his portrayal of the Baron and his environs seems to imitate Lynch\u2019s film in several scenes. The all-black industrial design of Geidi Prime and its ships, the Baron flying, and particularly the Baron\u2019s fondness for steam showers and motor-oil baths are all details from the 1984 movie that seem pretty obviously influenced (whether consciously or not) by the prior film. Did this jump out to anyone else?"

        "text": "So, for those that did not know, this was an early (started in 1997) and short lived CCG.  Only had two expansions, and only covered part of the first book in the sets released.  The basic idea is each player is playing a random minor house, picking one of nine 'sponsors' (Atreides, Harkonnen, Corrino, Bene Gesserit, Spacing Guild, Fremen, Water Sellers Union, Spice Miners Guild, or Smugglers) to help them become a Great House if they win (either by eliminating your opponent(s) or collecting enough Spice while having enough 'Favor'.  Opponents get eliminated by either running out of cards in their main deck and needing to draw again, or if they need to draw a card with 0\/negative 'Favor'.  There is also an optional rule that lets you win by ending a turn while controlling most of Dune).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was a kid when the game was originally released.  My dad bought a little bit for me and my brother and himself.  The cards were opened but never played.  Years later I decided to try to fill in my collection and have spent quite a while doing it.  The relative smallness of the game helped, they are not especially easy to find, or cheap (though I am glad I started when I did, they were considerably cheaper then than they seem to be now).  I completed the base set and first expansion, and have almost everything for the last set.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was likely going to just remain a collection, something interesting to occasionally look at.  But then I had a new idea last December.  I grabbed my dad's old collection, sorted it, took out the extras, and filled in a lot of the gaps from my extras.  Not as complete as my collection, but much more complete than his old collection.  Then gave that to him as a Christmas present.  He was happy about it, it will at some point get played, but don't know exactly when.  First, he needed new glasses to more easily read the cards\/rules.  Now with those its a matter of the time needed to learn the rules\/cards and put together decks (each player technically has 2 subdecks).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only minor downside is that it is a game that is probably stronger with more than 2 players.  But 2 is better than nothing."

Jason Mamoa, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem come to mind.  \n\nBut I made this corellation that perhaps why Denis' Dune works so well is that it is so similar to say....a famous UK actor deciding to take on MacBeth or Hamlet production.  We are not going to see \"Hamlet\" but instead to see \"Insert actor\" playing Hamlet.  I felt that instead of having them try to be the character outright, he just pulled the best acting abilities of cast period....not asking them to be an copy.\n\nMy go to is totally Duke Leto where Oscar Isaac is possibly playing the most mature version of his Oscaar Isaac-ness I've seen in his career.  In a lot of ways..it is entirely him.  But the setting (and obviously costume) gave him an air that is different from any other of his roles.  We can't separate the actor from the character often...but I felt Denis knew this so he decided this route to make it more acceptable than just a \"perfect casting\""

Physically striking, the artistic nature of the scenery is nothing short of captivating, to say nothing about how perfectly cast nigh-on every character is. In particular I found Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet's portrayal of Paul to be absolutely stupendous, the sense of unfounded potential he manages to emulate within our protagonist is marvellous.\n\nThe writers leave much to be excited for with the sequels, given the magnitude of events which unfold towards the end.\n\nWell, I must say - Villeneuve's Dune you had my curiosity, now you have my attention.\n\nEdit: Not my intention to say longtime fans won\u2019t enjoy this! I\u2019m simply implying it\u2019s common for fans of the original work (be that anything), to find more issues with adaptations! Lots of love people."

I was a little hesitant at first because I kept seeing posts of people not being able to get into it or the fact that when it originally came out, Herbert destroyed everyone's favorite hero. That's the general vibe I got before reading the book. But, guys, it was amazing. I do have to admit, it was a bit dense at first with the plotting but once everything started to unfold, it was magically done. Like Bijaz being placed to fuck with Idaho and not Paul, beautifully done. \n\nDuncan Idaho coming back did seem like an absurd fan service but the ending changed my mind. It was such well executed fan service that I now can't imagine that part of the story without the Ghola. \n\nI was noting Jessica's absence for a while and kind of missed her influence. I do like that they note she doesn't even want to be near her powerful children. And speaking of powerful, Alia sounds absolutely terrifying to be around. \n\nI think my favorite part of the book was understanding just how much Paul knew at the end. Him losing his eyes, going back to the sietch, losing his vision in his grief to regain it for a moment of clarity through Leto was freaking cinematic. \n\nOkay final moment I loved was Chani's last moment of coming back to the desert. It was like the calm before the storm and it felt well placed in the book. \n\nI can't wait to pick up Children of Dune. :D"

I think he\u2019ll be able to embody the emperor\u2019s complex emotions of being paranoid, charismatic, decadent whilst also being very calculative.  \n**Yara Shahidi - Princes Irulan**\n\n[Yara Shahidi](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/y98ek11dz8a81.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e32a9aa21c472a9ebd268568b197963c04e29a44)\n\nOne can argue that Yara hasn\u2019t had much larger roles in big films but irrespective of that, I think she would still give a good performance as Irulan. She, somewhat, gives off the vibes of an erudite plus she also has a regal aura which would be in line with Irulan\u2019s persona.  \n\n\n**Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd - Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen**  \n\n\n[Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/tur6wkkiz8a81.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=53f39b3bb5b96aa5690f75fb06bd97d149cec8a0)\n\nI can\u2019t think of anyone more fit to take on Feyd-Rautha other than Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd. His performance as Pennywise in IT readily comes to mind when I think of this role. Feyd-Rautha has been described to be both smart and charismatic whilst also being cruel and sadistic, which are characteristics that I feel that Bill is adept at portraying.  \n\n\nI couldn't decide on any performer that could portray Alia as I am not really familiar with children actresses and I am not sure who would be a good fit.  I didn't also make a casting choice for Hasimir Fenrig because since his character wasn't included in the first part, there won't be a need to bring him to the second part, but if I could make a choice, I'd suggest Pedro Pascal for that role.  \n\n\nThese are my own suggestions, I'll like to hear from others too."

Paul's the Emperor and worshipped kind of like a god. It's not like the Fremen would have gone offworld and conquered other planets without his sayso, is it (most of the Fremen we meet in Messiah are either content to live in a new, Wet-Ass-Arrakis or miss the old sietch days; relatively few beyond the priests seem to have such fanaticism that they'd commit genocide for Paul)? And Paul certainly wouldn't have chosen to go genocide up a bunch of other planets just for kicks, right?  \n\n\nAm I missing some important subtext about the nature of humanity that makes the Jihad a reasonable, foregone conclusion? Cause to me it feels like this big thing that everyone accepts as inevitable but is never actually justified in a direct or logical way."

Anyways, I'm talking about how, for example, arrakeen in the movie is just a bunch of weird geometrical shapes and stuff. Not a recognizable village or city by any stretch of the imagination. Or how the interiors are really empty and dull. I get that they're in the process of moving out, but everything feels dull. It's all the same light-brown color.\n\nWhereas in my mind, everything had a lot more flair. Arrakeen was similar to something like the city in aladdin, the spaceships were closer to star wars, etc.\n\nI kind of hope that this minimal thing doesn't carry over into dune messiah. Maybe it makes sense in Dune just because it's mostly a barren wasteland, but dune messiah seems to have so much more life in it. The bustling streets of arrakeen, the economical boom, the evolution of fremen culture as the younger generation no longer has to worry about survival, etc. It would be a shame if it was all toned down a couple notches to fit in with the aesthetic they have right now.\n\nOf course I still loved the movie and will still probably love messiah if it ever comes out, even if they go down the minimal route, but I'll probably feel a little bit disappointed. Just wanted to write my thoughts."

        "text": "Honestly this is my favorite entry in the series so far. It feels so consequential following the wake of Messiah. It's so masterful how Herbert has woven politics, religion, cultural erasure, and other heavy themes all into a fabulous story. Gonna gush about it.\n\nThe ecological transformation of Arrakis changing from a metaphor about oil and encroaching on land and peoples in the Middle East, to one of white saviorism and leaders thinking they know what's best for an indigenous people, but ultimately causing harm, is wonderful. Fremen drowning in the waters that Paul and the transformation had brought? Such a powerful microcosm for the bigger picture. \n\nWhile Paul was a warning about charismatic *leaders*, Alia is a glaring one for *politicians,* their true motivations, and how most, if not all, are destined to fall. Her corruption by the hand of the Baron captures the essence of the rich placing money in the pockets of politicians to turn them into lapdogs. She and her regency are also versed and keen on keeping people subjugated with the understanding to never let them be aware their common struggle and keep them in-fighting with one another. Having her throw herself from a window in her final moments of sanity is incredibly, fantastically blunt towards these politicians. \n\nReligion in this book is a display of the fanaticism destined to follow Paul even past his death. It serves to outline how, if Jesus himself were to return today, his words would fall upon deaf ears belonging to those claiming to be his followers. It continues as a malleable vessel of control in the hands of Leto and Alia. Even outside this manipulative use, Children is disparaging of religion in describing its holes, ignorance, preachings against questioning, active need for irreverence, and the bored nature of an all-powerful god. Very therapeutic speaking as someone who recently left the church.\n\nAnd this is all consequential of Paul and his actions throughout Dune and Messiah. He brought about the ecological transformation. He took advantage of religion. He left a power vacuum. He left a mess for others to clean. And in doing so he birthed something worse than himself; an all-powerful leader who thinks only *he* can lead humanity on what *he* thinks is right. It's a fantastic work and I could talk about it for hours. Still timeless and horrifically, terrifyingly relevant.\n\nEdit: added a small line or two + grammar"

        "text": "Am I the only one that has not fallen over in love with Denis' version of the film? I never see anyone say anything but huge praise for the film. \n\nI'm a huge Dune fan since about '93. I saw the '84 version just on a whim and loved it. I ran out and got the first book and since then I've purchased and read, reread, and rereread every Herbert book out there, dune and otherwise. \n\nI understand that '84 is not perfect and that Lynch took liberties that people don't like, myself included. But I find that '21 does not add anything that wasn't in '84. And....only covers half the material.\n\nYou get me? There is almost not a single scene in '21 that isn't also in '84. So why is it taking two movies to cover the EXACT same material. \n\nI feel '84 did a much better job of showing Doctor Yueh's loyalties, his struggles, his anguish. '21 failed in that in my opinion. \n\n'84 did a much better job of showing how critical water is on Arrakis. '21 skimmed over it and it felt like an afterthought. \n\n'84 focused much more on walking without rhythm through the desert. It was mentioned in '21 and then quickly forgotten it seems. \n\nMaybe I need to rewatch it. But I was far less impressed than everyone else seems to be. I know I'll get all the hate here, but I just have to say it once and move on."

        "text": "What an action scene in this one! Miles is covering the escape of the ghola and Lucilla in a violent fashion in the snowy forests on Gammu. He's a one man army cutting down Face Dancers with his lasgun like it's going out of style but their numbers are seemingly endless. He drains the charge and let's it sputter to let them think he's empty, luring them closer into a choke point before opening up on them with a second lasgun. After wreaking havoc he's eventually caught from the back.\n\nThis scene reminded me of a part in Ernest Hemingway's book For Whom the Bell Tolls. During the Spanish Civil War a soldier is ambushed by Francoist forces in the mountains and casualties mount until he is the only survivor from his unit. He has the high ground and plays dead behind an obstruction to draw the enemy closer into a concentrated area where he then opens up on them with his lewis gun. He speaks of recognizing and eliminating the commander just as Teg does. The enemy mysteriously retreats just before dive bombers kill him.\n\nIt's probably just in my head but maybe Franky was inspired by Hemmingway to make a similar scene. \n\nMaybe that's where he got his horniness too."

Perhaps God Emperor is just a window into a rather volatile period on Arrakis after millennia of security.  Perhaps Leto II wants to be a personal lightning rod for dissent in his empire and permits or even encourages these threats.  Still, it is hard to imagine why a ruler with his immense knowledge, power, and vision would be in constant physical danger in his own capital."

        "text": "I read the 6 Frank Herbert Dune books two years ago and started to re-read them after seeing the movie. Unlike Dune, which ends almost immediately after the defeat of the Emperor, CoD goes on for a few more chapters after Alia's defeat. It begins to establish Leto's empire with Ghanima as his wife (no incest though), Farad'n becoming his scribe and handing over the Sardukar, finally uniting House Corrino with House Atreides, fun banter between Stilgar and Tyekanik who will both lead Leto's forces to bring peace to the empire. The Fremen can go back to their desert, at least for a hundred years, until the Arakis climate has changed too much. Even Lady Jessica is doing relatively okay after watching her possessed daughter jump out a window and her grandson become a worm monster.\n\nThe Golden Path has been laid out for humanity and all the characters fall into place for their own futures in this new empire. It all seems great until the very last line of the book. After Leto II leaves his hall, Ghanima says to Farad'n, \"One of us had to accept the agony, and he was always the stronger\". We get hints of this sentiment when Leto II is talking with Paul about the decisions he has made, but having it as the last line of your happy ending is impactful. It perfectly sets up God Emperor of Dune thousands of years later where we see the agony Leto II has gone through during his reign."

        "text": "Was it necessary or was it Leto becoming an abomination like Alia and making a deal with Harum an autocrat and dictator who wants to be worshiped and wants to rule with an iron fist akin to Alia\u2019s deal with the Baron?\n\nAt the end of Children of Dune, he says, \"When I was asked if I was abomination, I answered in the negative. That was my first treachery.\"\n\nHe also talks about having formed a community of his ancestors one that he leads along with Paul, his grandfather who was killed by the infamous bull and of course Harum. \n\nLeto also says \"I am not, in truth, Harum. And I am not my father. Then again, I am not the second Leto.\"\n\nIs that not an abomination like the BG feared? \n\nWho is Harum? \n\n\"I'm a community dominated by one who was ancient and surpassingly powerful. He fathered a dynasty which endured for three thousand of our years. His name was Harum and, until his line trailed out in the congenital weaknesses and superstitions of a descendant, his subjects lived in a rhythmic sublimity. They moved unconsciously with the changes of the seasons. They bred individuals who tended to be short-lived, superstitious, and easily led by a god-king. Taken as a whole, they were a powerful people. Their survival as a species became habit\u201d\n\nInteresting Harum who is described as a God King aids Leto to become the God Emperor to lead a group of people across his imperium who are easily kept in hand and led by Leto\u2019s order\/peace and a superstitious sublime group of bred individuals in the fishspeakers.\n\nCould Leto have been wrong about the Golden Path? It is argued about the nature of prescience whether the oracle sees the vision or creates it. When Leto talks with Paul in the desert Paul states that he did not see humanities extinction if the Golden Path was not followed or taken. Leto also states that Paul\u2019s oracular vision is better than his. It can be argued how far Paul chose to look down  the path after the Jihad and toward his terrible purpose but he admits to Leto his auditor that he did not see it. \n\nCould the reason Paul warns Leto from the Golden Path is the same as when he offered his aid to Alia, that he could see that Leto was being possessed by an ancestor, that he could see his madness? Harum was an ancient king who wanted to be worshiped and was charismatic and Leto openly allied with him and allowed him to dominate his personality. How much of that conversation in the desert was father and son and how much was Harum convincing Paul to die for him so that the myth of Muadib could die so that the God Emperor of which he would be could rule?\n\nCould it be that Leto was seeing the future that he wants to see? Could he even be seeing the future that Harum wants to see? Could they have seen or created a future that necessitated becoming\/ruling as a god emperor and being worshiped for millennia as a tyrant and also as a savior? \n\nCould that vision be what created the threat that Leto and only Leto foresaw until sionna? Unlike with Paul\u2019s jihad we don\u2019t know much about the other timelines that Leto eradicated in Children of Dune. Did any of those offer a different alternative to the Golden path that didn\u2019t have the extinction in them? \n\nDid Leto chose the golden path to appease Harum that lead to the extinction for the sole purpose of saving humanity?\n\nAll we have is God Emperor of Dune which is in effect a historical retelling of Letos own journals which are filled with his own justifications and reasons for the Golden Path. But is this not the sort of person that Herbert has spent 3 books warning against? \n\nA charismatic leader? A hero? A book where we only have Leto\u2019s own tortured writings compiled to go about his existence which can make many feel sympathetic for him. \n\nShould we ignore the horrors of the Duncan\u2019s at what Leto has done how far from the nobility of the atreides or Siona who had killed Leto whom she believed was a madman and torturing humanity with his enforced stagnation or even Moneo Stilgar\u2019s descendent who served Leto loyally wrestled with what Leto was doing. \n\nWas there really no other way to ensure Humanities survival? The bene gesserit seemed to be shocked by Paul\u2019s jihad and completely unaware of what Leto was doing. This could have been due to them lacking their male ancestral memory but they continued to ask Leto about his plans to aid him with no answer. \n\nIt\u2019s A fascinating thought and really changes the way you read the book. Was Leto a tortured hero? An Antihero? Or a mad tyrant, an abomination like his aunt who believed in his own delusions and reshaped the universe to the whims of an ancient god king. I\u2019d be interested to hear your thoughts!"

But honestly I liked it a great deal. \n\nPerhaps the genre shift from space epic to a more political based tragedy was jarring for some, but I really liked seeing what it was like for Paul to rule as emperor and have prescience. I was surprised to hear in the intro that a lot of people thought Dune was a straight as an arrow telling of the heroes journey because when I finished dune, I was actually a bit iffy in my support of Paul, he seemed robotic and just okay to let the jihad happen to get revenge. But in Messiah it was fascinating to see him deal with regret for past and future actions, and that his prescience was more a curse than anything. Paul was someone I wasn\u2019t even rooting for by the end of Dune, but by the time I finished Messiah, I was actually really sad to follow him on the journey to his downfall. Messiah completely answered my questions about Paul from the end of the first novel and made me empathize with him. \n\nAlso would love to praise the whole Ghola Duncan Idaho character. Seeing him deal with his identity crisis and want to find out who he actually is was really fascinating stuff, I let out a smile when he fully realized himself at the end of the novel, something that seemed kinda gimmicky when I was introduced to it ended up being a high point of the novel for me. Messiah was great and excited to continue with Children of Dune!"

I'm a set designer and I'm excited to announce that I recently launched a new YouTube channel where I review and discuss design in movies, with a focus on sci-fi, named Seeing Wonder! I was extra motivated to launch the channel after watching Dune (2021) and the first episode is about that movie's design work. I've always wanted to teach design somehow so I hope this is a way for me to pass on some things I've learned while also allowing me the chance to talk about design work that gives me a sense of wonder and inspires me to create. Here are the links to the first episode:\n\nDune - Design Review #1: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/k0mAhQfmDIQ](https:\/\/youtu.be\/k0mAhQfmDIQ)\n\nI've put a lot of work into getting this started and I hope you enjoy it! The format is a bit too dry and academic for my liking right now, and it's funny how nervous I get while recording into my mic alone in my apartment, but I hope to make future episodes a bit more entertaining. Please let me know what you think and if you like what you see, **please subscribe** \\- this really helps the channel in these early days!! Thanks!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: The theme music is by\u00a0Matthew McCheskey:\n\n[https:\/\/matthewmccheskey.bandcamp.com\/](https:\/\/matthewmccheskey.bandcamp.com\/)\n\n[https:\/\/nightvoice.bandcamp.com\/](https:\/\/nightvoice.bandcamp.com\/)"

We get the biggest questions answered: The Golden Path, Leto II\u00b4s sacrifice, the breeding programme, the complete ramifications of terraforming Dune, etc. The nature of the Golden Path itself thematically justifies not \u201cknowing\u201d what will happen next.\n\nI should also say this upfront: I **hate** Duncan and Siona. To say I hate Duncan would be an understatement, I doubt I\u2019ll be able to endure any more chapters from his POV. \n\nAnd overall I\u2019ve not really any larger questions for the series. Sure the Famine and revitalization of the sandworms were alluded to, but knowing they\u2019ll happen I'm not too invested in craving the details. Everything I wanted explained was already done so in this book, or likely not to get explained at all. Malky for example was kept mostly ambiguous and that won\u2019t change. If ever I do revisit the series it would probably be after Villeneuve\u2019s Part 2."

I think it's because so much of the story is written from Leto's perspective, but he is a horrible bloodthirsty pretentious asshole of a tyrant and it's just so unusual to have such an obvious antagonist as the main character. I read a couple comments on this sub that sounded very sympathetic to Leto... I know he whines about the sacrifice and the loneliness he has to endure (to, what, oppress humanity for thousands or years???) but he's not supposed to be a sympathetic character at all, right? With all of his pretentious whiny better-than-thou monologuing sometimes I wondered what I was supposed to think of him. The way I understood it, the story was about the power of the little people overcoming the oppression of religious fanaticism by defeating \"God\", and Leto was meant to be a hateful villain no matter what he said he was doing \"for the good of humanity\". Did others have a different perspective on this book?"

The fact that man was able to win the Butlerian Jihad, a war against thinking machines is highly unlikely  in my opinion. That is if artificial intelligence never actually threatened humanity but were in use until the Jihad began."

The Harkonnen are actually creepy, incestuous-looking, sociopathic pedos in this one.

I just recently read somewhere that the 2021 movie covers only the first half of the first book, and a second movie will follow. My question is to people who have both read and watched them. Can I already watch the movie without spoiling anything I haven't read yet? My preferred way of getting to know anything about the story and the world is really by reading.  \n\n\nIn the book, I am at the part where >!Paul and Lady Jessica is escaping, they have left their thropter to a worm after the storm, and Paul has just saved Jessica from under a sandslide and then their backpack. The section ends with them staring into the desert, having just seen a huge worm. Next section is with Gurney Halleck, who we haven't come across yet since the Harkonnen attack. Hawat is captured by the Harkonnens and the Baron already knows about it and is planning to get Hawat on his side. I guess that's it.!< So does the movie go further than this in any of the plotlines? Or even if not, would you still recommend to read the whole book first, as they implement some information in the movie that we only get to know later in the book (ie. about the Fremen or worms)? My feeling is that the movie goes further than this in the plot, maybe the second half of the book is more packed with action and they made the cute further than just half.  \n\n\nI'd be fine waiting until I read the whole book, but my boyfriend is patiently and super nicely waiting for me to read it so we can watch it together. But he can't to watch it already. And I was wondering if I could already \"end his suffering\" and watch it with him instead of waiting until I'm finished with the book. I'd appreciate any help with this, if someone has the time to think it through. Of course no spoilers please from the second half of the book or further."

        "text": "In Dune Messiah the twins Ghanima and Leto are both born pre-born, as Alia was. Frank Herbert explains this as the result of the twins being born to a woman with a deep spice addiction. The contraceptive that Irulan administered to Chani in secret had the side effect that, when Chani did conceive, she required massive amounts of spice in her diet to sustain their development.  Herbert then goes on to explain that a similar phenomenon produced Alia's pre-born birth, with the Lady Jessica receiving a massive dose of spice through the Water of Life ceremony making her a new Reverend Mother. \n\nBut this is ostensibly not what happened.\n\nIn Dune the process by which Alia came into consciousness in the womb with all the memories of the Reverend Mothers which came before her was very explicitly described.  When the prior Reverend Mother of Sietch Tabr transfers her memories to Lady Jessica during the Water of Life ceremony, she is unable to prevent those memories from also transferring to Alia, which had not realized was growing within Jessica.  As such Alia gains consciousness through these memories while still in the womb, resulting in her being pre-born.  It had nothing to do with the amount of spice. In fact it's never really stated or implied in Dune that the Water of Life contains a lot of spice at all.  Herbert describes the Water of Life almost as a different metabolite of the worm metabolism, which may be related to spice but is deadly poisonous.  \n\nAdditionally there are other profound inconsistencies in the pre-birth phenomenon between Dune and Children of Dune which very heavily impact the plot of the latter. \n\nIn Dune it's quite explicit that only the memories of the Reverend Mothers which form the chain of Reverend Mothers who have performed the Water of Life ceremonies to generate new Reverend Mothers leading to Lady Jessica are transferred to Jessica and Alia, a kind of accumulation through chain of transfer.  But in Children it is stated that pre-born individuals can not only access the memories of ALL of their genetic ancestors, but can basically channel, and even be possessed by, the minds of those ancestors.  Even if we grant that possessing all the memories of a person is sufficient to effectively recreate their consciousness, that is not at all consistent with the mechanism by which Reverend Mothers possess the memories of previous Reverend Mothers. \n\nIt seems that Herbert wants two things.  He seems to want the status of Kwisatz Haderach, once attained, to be genetic, and he wants to establish the concept of genetic memory. It seems like he could've just done these things.  Paul's status of Kwisatz Haderach was very largely genetic, and genetic memory, while making no sense in the real world, makes no less sense than the Water of Life memory transfer.\n\nWhy this retcon.  It's major, and it's sloppy.\n\nThoughts?  Am I missing something?"

It\u2019s intellectually grating this even happened at all and how much the story continued to linger on it. \n\nThere\u2019s no catharsis when Hwi shares Leto\u2019s \u201csoul\u201d or calls him \u201cLove.\u201d It was probably a week in between since she was doting on Duncan and calling him \u201cLove\u201d too. Leto II out here sacrificed EVERYTHING in order to save the human species and amidst it all... Hwi and Duncan\u2019s horny shenanigans. Fuck me it\u2019s embarrassing. I probably had to sit through a dozen POV chapters of Duncan pining for Hwi and feeling emasculated. Additional note, the idea of making Duncan homophobic was hilarious, I want some of that spice Frank was having.\n\nThe stain on the story was not worth the return at all to me:\n\nWhat actually was achieved in the end? Duncan wasn\u2019t acknowledged once by Hwi in her last chapters.    \nWill she, won\u2019t she pregnant with Duncan\u2019s child??    \nThen: She dies anyways lol doesn\u2019t matter.    \nWhat strikes me the most is that Duncan had the audacity to blame and straight up murder Nayla for following his own plan to blow up the bridge. Did it not occur to him the cort\u00e8ge of a wedding party might... include the people being wed, together?\n\nDuncan also seemed to not be affected by the death of Hwi enough, already holding Siona\u2019s (who was somehow absolved of blame for Hwi\u2019s death) hand and thinking about giving her babies.. LOL\n\nThe endpoint of the whole affair of Hwi and Duncan resolves in Duncan (potentially) learning consequence and responsibility for his actions? What a shit payoff, I say and for reasons above it feels very empty and easily avoidable in its melodrama.\n\nMourning Leto II rn. And shoutout to my boy Moneo for being able to find his peace in the end, in spite of being killed by his own daughter.\n\nAfter finishing the book I can say it\u2019s definitely generated the most mixed feelings out of me so far in contrast to the previous entries. I\u2019ve dumped all my most negative thoughts here since I left the book feeling like shit (who didn\u2019t feel like shit after that ending?). But I will say Leto II had some of the best moments out of the entire series, the book is a solid read just for him, but I\u2019ll get into more positive stuff in another thread probably.\n\nPS: I desperately wanted more Malky, shame he was kept ambiguous."

After about a third of the way through the book I had to check how many pages were left - I thought it was about to climax! \n\n[Spoiler] My favorite part (there were lots of them) was the \"My skin is not my own\" repetition during Leto's spice trance. I thought it referred to the many voice and lifetimes Leto was observing in the moment, and felt that it was odd to repeat it so many times. However, later when he waded into the sandtrouts and I realized what was happening I was utterly shocked. I ripped through the rest of the book in horror. A book has never throw me that off guard before. Can't wait to reread this one and pick up on so many of the clues Frank left near the beginning and in previous books. Looking forward to God Emperor"

        "text": "I just finished re-reading the book (first time was as a teenager) and I really enjoyed it. I do have a few questions though, hope you guys can help. Also obviously SPOILERS AHEAD:  \n\n\n\\- At the end, when both the Baron Harkonnen and the Emperor go to Arrakis, why would they land in the planet themselves? I could of course understand landing the Harkonnen and Sardaukar troops, but why would they expose themselves to any danger and instead not just hang out in orbit while the fighting is happening? It's not like they fight in the first line anyway. I understand that they might have underestimated the strength of the fremen, but by now they already knew how hard they had been to manage and it specially feels super careless considering how extremely careful the Baron had proven to act otherwise (wearing his shield even when approaching naked\/drugged Leto, surviving na-Baron's assesination attempts, etc.).\n\n\\- What was Hawats revenge plan with the Baron? Towards the end we learn that he still hates the Baron and that he is planning some scheme against him, but I dont think we ever learn what. He puts the idea in his mind to go to Arrakis, but he didn't know that Paul was Muad Dib and what fate the Baron would find in Arrakis.\n\n\\- Maybe a stretch, but did Duke Leto have access to atomics, and if so, why didnt he use them as a deterrent in Arrakis? I understand use of Atomics is not allowed, but he could have had them in Arrakeen as a last resource in case they were attacked and overwhelmed (like they were). By self immolating as a last resource, the evidence of an attack by the Harkonnens and the involvement of the Emperor would be clear, and the Landsraad would be able to mobilize and avange the attack, which in turn would be enough of a deterrent for any attackers. I also don't think such atomics would be in danger of sabotage by the at that time unknown traitor (yueh) as Yueh's goal was to kill the Baron, which he wouldnt achieve by killing himself."

        "text": "TLDR: Prophets' minds are able to construct cutting-edge machine learning models that, given sufficient data in the form of ancestral memories, can predict a very broad class of future outcomes with a huge degree of certainty.\n\nI just finished Children of Dune it was quite tough to get through. But boy, oh boy, was it worth it. Shameless plug: link to my [Goodreads review](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/review\/show\/4445067125?book_show_action=false).\n\nWhile reading through, something dawned on me regarding the Kwisatz Haderach's prescient abilities in the Dune Universe that is rather similar to the way in which humans currently \"predict\" future outcomes with some degree of uncertainty. I also present a hypothesis regarding what sets Leto's prescience apart from Paul's, but it feels a little tenuous. I have yet to read the following books in the series, so please do not spoil anything that is not in Dune, Dune Messiah or Children of Dune. Here goes:\n\nWe know that the Kwisatz Haderach must be a mentat with Bene Gesserit abilities. Now, what does a mentat do? They perform profoundly intricate and multivariate computations to estimate the likelihoods of potential outcomes and provide advice based on their analyses. We also know that the accuracy of their outputs is entirely dependent upon the volume and accuracy of data that they receive. So, in a sense, mentats' minds enable them to create cognitive models of aspects of reality based on the data with which they are provided and then utilize said models to predict future states of those aspects of reality - as I write this, I recall that this is literally how the human mind works lol. All of this is stated within the original Dune book.\n\nThis is where the Bene Gesserit abilities come in; in particular, those of a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother. What separates the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mothers from the rest of their order is, essentially, their ability to access ancestral memories and, as a result, their ancestors' consciousnesses. This is obviously an immensely powerful tool for implementing plans over thousands of years. However, for a mentat, access to such a storehouse of experiences and memories from hundreds of thousands of years of human history (and further back in the evolutionary process for Leto) is a veritable gold mine of input data that the mentat can use to \u201ctrain\u201d their model of the future (to use a machine learning term) and thereby predict potential outcomes with greater and greater certainty, further and further into the future.\n\nIt seems that what sets Leto II apart even from Paul is his mastery over his inner lives and the much greater wealth of ancestral memories that enables him to see so much farther into the future than Paul ever did. This is because he not only has access to more data but he also engineered (organised it, created pipelines for incoming data from his visions, etc.) his databases (his ancestors' consciousnesses) so that they can be put to better use. This, in turn, enables him to make better and more accurate predictions of events thousands of years in the future with near certainty.\n\nThis is not all that profound today, but to think that this is what FH may have intended almost 6 decades ago is honestly mind-boggling.\n\n**I'd love to know what others think about this, but please do refrain from spoiling anything that is not in Dune, Dune Messiah or Children of Dune. If my interpretation is incorrect and your rebuttal involves spoilers from the other books, please just tell me I am wrong and I will take your word for it.**"

And then later in the Thopter, Leto and Paul etc are viewing the harvester in full day light. I can\u2019t remember the book specifying a time for the harvesters to go out but this seems a bit of a contradiction.\n\nJust to be clear, this is about the only very minor issue I have with the film which is as far as I\u2019m concerned, a masterpiece. Just wondered if anyone had thoughts about the above or explanations? Please feel free to berate me if it\u2019s something obvious."

Started off with Brian talking about his relationship with his father and the slow success of Dune, interesting enough, then bam out of nowhere Messiah is spoiled. Seriously, WTH? It's quite upsetting after the amount of time I put into reading Dune to just have the the story spoiled like that.\n\nThe book should have a warning before the Afterword. I'm also really surprised with the massive amount of new readers that are coming into Dune, that there isn't any mention of this in any of the FAQs here. Can this please be added to hopefully prevent this for other new readers?\n\nAnyone else get spoiled this way?"

To take fellow sisters who don\u2019t agree with the merge and plan on heading to a new area to start another Muad\u2019Dib? I know she considered pulling a Leto but what is she planning with that power and religion?\n\nThird and final question is what was the \u201cnet\u201d Duncan can see and how can he disrupt the face dancers using it?"

And your mother's move is to present you with a religious army.\n\nMoreover, why did Paul play the role of Prophet knowing that the pious soldiers in his service would lead to Jihad? Why did not Paul deny his role immediately? \n\n\nIf I remember correctly, it was written in the book that Paul did not want to compromise his leadership and therefore did not deny his messianic role.  \n\nBut I still don't understand why he kept going even though he was so afraid of his prescient visions.  \n\nBTW I have read only the first book."

It\u2019s also another example of love ruling over any conditioning and type of authority. Thematically it makes sense but any likability attached to these characters is now removed for me. Does anyone just feel extremely disturbed by their relationship? I think I have okay reasons to hate them, but for all the fucked up shit that happened in Dune it sounds ridiculous that I find their stupid liaison evokes the most disgust. \n\nMoneo\u2019s a homie though.

        "text": "I\u2019ve got about 90 pages of GEoD left, and man what a ride it\u2019s been. My Dune experience has largely felt like an enduring contemplative haze. But this installment has been that experience on Semuta. I\u2019ve found that I can\u2019t read more than a few chapters at a time without stopping to digest. Put simply, rich fare\u2026heady stuff.\n\nAnyway, I read the chapter where Duncan confronts Moneo about the \u201crotten\u201d behaviors he observed in the Fish Speakers\u2019 corridor, and I still can\u2019t figure out what to make of it. I think the crux of the argument is in the following quote:\n\n> All of us try to evolve, but if something blocks us, we can transfer our potential into pain\u2014seeking it or giving it. Adolescents are particularly vulnerable\u2026Military commanders have known about the perverted displacement of sex into pain for thousands upon thousands of centuries.\n\nMy best interpretation is that sexual promiscuity is a natural compliment to the violence of war, and so fostering one bolsters the other. In other words, allow hormonal young people to explore their sexual desires and you\u2019ll get a strong loyal army as a result.\n\nI also get the sense that this conversation ties into earlier ones where Leto explains the benefits of an all-female army. It seems to me that the God Emperor\u2019s war strategy centers around these ideas.\n\nWhat do y\u2019all think? I\u2019m sure I\u2019m missing something here, but what\u2019s your takeaway from Moneo\u2019s explanations or on the philosophy of the Fish Speakers in general?"

        "text": "Seriously, wtf did I just read? What happened? You go from God Emperor, which was so so good, this nuanced study of burdens and difficult choices and the isolation those bring with some sexual undertones sprinkled in - nothing wrong with a little sex - to ALL HORNY JAIL ALL THE TIME. Like, how did we get here? I am no prude, stuff like the Witcher and Game of Thrones books are my jam, but everything is sex now. EVERYTHING.\n\n\\- The God Emperor's Golden Path? Wasn't it supposed to be this unbelievable symphony of cause and effect stretching ahead for millenia, a design intended to ensure humanity's survival? Nah, it's just sex because procreation. Like, okay, technically you're not wrong, a species needs to procreate to survive, but that's such a weird thing to focus on whyyyyy.\n\n\\- The reason behind the new Big Bad power advantage? Is it superior technology? Alien science? Harnessing of eldritch horrors? No, they're just really good at sex.\n\n\\- The secret weapon that is the single lynchpin that gives our protagonists a hope at thwarting this menace? This one kid who is even better at sex than they are.\n\n\\- The Bene Gesserit getting all huffy and morally superior to the point of referring to the Honored Matres almost exclusively as \"whores\" is funny on so many levels I'm not even going to get into that one.\n\n\\- The Harkonnen no-globe having a bunch of lewd clocks and murals in it gets a pass because it's well established that Harkonnens are these opulently indulgent, hedonistic people, so that's on brand and that's a good example of using that sort of imagery effectively. Because of course they would.\n\n\\- Lucilla needs to don a disguise as a high-price sex worker, basically, and this, for some reason, requires her to actually do the deed beforehand and involves a verbal sparring match between her and the other woman who brings her disguise about who knows more about how to be the best at sex. This never comes into play in any way, shape or form. It's completely irrelevant. The only reason for this scene to exist is to cause the term \"vaginal pulsing\" to forever occupy real estate in my brain until the day I die and I hate this world because of it.\n\n\\- Although nobody wanting to bone Lucilla being almost a running joke in this book is hilarious to me. Sure, Burzmali was down for it that one time, but when she suggests a repeat, he just goes to sleep and I laughed and I'm pretty sure I wasn't supposed to.\n\n\\- Not even LITERAL CHILDREN are exempt from this. Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, I need a shower. Between the sexual imprinting (WHY IS THAT A THING) and Sheeana having practical sex ed classes when she's like, what, fourteen?\n\n\\- When I got to the point when a major plot point was a live sex act with an actual child watching, I honestly wasn't even surprised.\n\n\\- Why is Miles Teg so horny? Literal human computer. Like, he mentally labels one of his guard captains as \"captain seductive eyes\", which, okay, granted, in the context of the conversation\/story, it makes sense that he would be hyper aware of the fact that certain traits are included in people by design, but when he wakes up in a literal TORTURE CHAIR and notices one of his TORTURERS who is there to TORTURE him is female, he does wonder what her figure is like under those robes? YOU'RE ABOUT TO BE TORTURED MILES, WAY TO SET THE PRIORITIES.\n\nThank you for coming to my ~~therapy session~~ Ted talk.\n\nI just needed to vent. I literally finished this book minutes ago and I need to process wtf I just read. I just got into this series, I've been in awe of the first four books, absolutely adored them and sung their praises to high heaven to anyone who would listen to me for five seconds. I was so excited for more Dune. I mean, there is good stuff in it, don't get me wrong, but I can't get past how creepily horny it is all the time. Once it started popping up, I kept seeing it everywhere. Frank was in his 60s at the time, too, which - I can't shake the image of a creepily horny old man drooling over how hot and good at sex everyone is. There is precisely one thematic point in the entire 600+ page story that is relevant - the many ways in which sex can be used, what all it can mean, and how messed up it is if it's used as a lever to control someone with. And a related point about addiction that comes in at the very end of the book and you can honestly miss it if you blink at the right time. That's it. That's all.\n\nI'm sorry, I'm rambling. But, yeah, still trying to figure out what I even think about this thing. After this one, I did some research (as much as I could without getting into spoilers) and I heard that Chapterhouse is even hornier somehow? Is that true?\n\nEDIT: Hoooo boy. Did not expect to get this much response. I am relatively new-ish to the Dune fandom, so it's awesome to see this level of discussion even on little, ranty posts like mine. And I have to say, everyone in the comments - whether we agree or disagree - I am VERY impressed with the depth and level of discourse. Amazing. And thank you for recommendations on podcasts or other books! I will definitely check them out!\n\nAnother thing I wanted to perhaps clarify, going by some of the comments, is that whatever SEXY issues I had with the SEXY *Heretics* isn't that it's going into SEXY themes and SEXY times because I'm squeamish and can't handle sex in media. The reason why it jumped at me was that it felt there wasn't much context for it at times, nor was there purpose. Take *God Emperor of Dune*, for example, which is a strong contender for my favorite *Dune* book of all time with the first one. People say it's horny as well, Nayla gets all hot and bothered watching Duncan climb. But there, it serves a big, thematic point. Sex is something that's very close and intimate, it allows people to explore each other and share in a very naked (metaphorically as well as literally) revealing way. At the same time, it's this base, primal, *biological* thing. This contrasts and highlights two things about Leto II: (i) just how utterly, abjectly and infinitely lonely he is; by committing to the Golden Path and transforming into the man\/worm thing, he is incapable of having that kind of intimacy with anyone, ever. For THOUSANDS of years. He is literally the loneliest creature in the universe; and (ii) the sheer magnitude of his sacrifice. In order to pursue the Golden Path and ensure a future for humanity, he has gone so far as to no longer be capable of the base biological function that everyone around him enjoys - procreation. He is no longer human in the most fundamental, biological sense. And it adds so much weight and sorrow to him. The fact that he's literally surrounded by it - the Fish Speakers, the Syianoq, his breeding program, and yeah, even that instance with Nayla and Duncan - only sets him apart from the rest of humanity further. Even in the middle of it, he's so completely removed from this basic, simple, relatable thing he might as well be completely alien. I LOVE this. I have ZERO issues with this. *THIS* is a fantastic use of it.\n\nHere, maybe I need to read *Chapterhouse*, maybe I need to sit on it more, but I just don't see that connection. A lot of it feels divorced from any theme, character or story. Upon reflection, I can see why it would matter in the BG\/HM dynamic, the contrast that's implied there and the very basic \"sex is power\" theme, but I'm failing to see it in other contexts, especially when it comes to almost anything related to Lucilla. Or Murbella, for that matter, who feels like she was supposed to be Lucilla's foil in the story, but is only brought in at the last moment and I'm not sure what she's supposed to \"foil\" there beyond beating Lucilla to the punch when it comes to Duncan. Hopefully she plays a bigger role in *Chapterhouse* and this is explored, but as-is, Lucilla's character serves absolutely no purpose in the story beyond making Doctor Freud touch himself in his grave. Anyway, I still don't see a point why Lucilla's disguise required her doing a reverse Monica Lewinsky - like, why. On the off chance they would stopped by someone, they would be suspicious as to whether she really is a playfem, and she could go \"no, but look! I've got this man's baby juice alll over me! Feel free to do a swab and impromptu testing to confirm this indeed is baby juice, random stranger on the street!\" What was the point of that? Nor - and this is a hill I will die on - is there a point to her verbally comparing sex prowess with the other woman. Others have pointed how that could serve the story, but I'm sorry, I don't see a purpose there beyond it being shoved in, deep and hard, so that you could get all that \"vaginal pulsing\" in your face (why is this now in my brain forever).\n\nThe \"addiction\" angle is the most interesting part about it, tbh, but it's only really brought up at the last moment and not much is done with it at all. Maybe *Chapterhouse?* \n\nOne thing I DO like, however, is how sex becomes this scary, terrifying thing. I love how every time Duncan asks \"what is Lucilla supposed to do to me?\" Teg just goes quiet with this implied cloud of dread hanging over the conversation. Very nicely echoed when Teg then meets the Honored Matre, does not know what \"marking\" means, but he just gets this sense of foreboding (it's like poetry, it rhymes). Little touches like that. Very nice. There's also a very interesting discussion about how sex can also be this scary thing, which, if the book went into that direction, that would be time well spent. But again, it's buried under this mountain of unnecessary horniness, I feel like I need to dig for it.\n\nSo yeah, tl;dr - the point I'm trying to make is not \"horny bad\". The point is \"horny good if in context\" and I feel like in *Heretics,* it's a mixture of good, bad, baffling and outright disgusting. You may agree with me, you may disagree with me, I'm just one person on the internet and that's my take. And that's good. Great, actually - like I said, I love the discussion in the comments, did not expect that AT ALL lol.\n\nThank you all and happy New Year :)"

The first four of Dune, and Seveneves are the only sci-fi literature I\u2019ve read. \n\nI feel like I was waiting for Dune to come out for so long that I needed a new fix. \n\nIf you are like me, I strongly recommend The Expanse. I\u2019m almost done with season 2, and I already feel very confident in recommending it. I cannot wait to read the books.\n\nThe character building\/development has been amazing. There\u2019s a ton of political intrigue. There are no loose ends in the writing (or the physics). Along with surprisingly good visuals for a tv budget show.\n\nThe first season is a bit confusing and slow moving, but that\u2019s because it\u2019s so rich and detailed. It really picks up in season 2. After each episode I keep getting surprised at how good it is.\n\nIt\u2019s really well done, and if you give it a chance you will not be disappointed."

The Jesus Incident did not really appeal to me, but the premise of the Dosadi Experiment seems oddly similar, yet fresh, to that of Dune. \n\nCurious about it, has anyone here read it? Is it close to Dune's quality? Does it have this big, blockbuster epic feeling to it?  Any takes are appreciated. I know it's a sequel to a previous book and short stories, but those did very little for me (couldn't finish The Whipping Star)."

Assassins creed odyssey for example, makes a great superhero game with the badass unarmed combat and parkour.  \nOddly enough, Valhalla\u2019s rapid knife combat + modern uniform scratched that itch for a while, especially with a squad of similarly dressed raiders. Time traveling sardaukar or some shit. It worked for me.\n\nIs there a future-feudalist game where swords or knives are a valid build? Maybe squad based? Maybe 4x with troop customization? Desert setting is a plus.  Thanks."

        "text": "You! Yes, you! Did you know that, years ago, a book called Dune was released? And did you know that it spawned all sorts of merchandise, such as Dune the videogame, Dune the comic, and Dune the breakfast cereal? And did you know that, years later, a movie would be released? Which wasn't very good? And then a tv series and later another movie, and then a book about that movie?\n\nThis is a review of that movie after the tv series after the movie of the book.\n\nIn all seriousness, The Art and Soul of Dune is a bloody big, luxurious book which takes you behind the scenes of the new movie. Written by executive producer Tanya Lapointe, this tackles so many topics from the movie - in the order you see them in the movie. Starting with forewords, we move on to what we see on Caladan (so the scenery, castle designs, casting for the Atreides family and staff, Heighliners, even filmbooks and glowglobes are talked about), we do the same for Giedi Prime, Salusa Secundus, and finally Arrakis taking up the meat of the book.\n\nAnd how luxurious it is! This book has lots of full-page spreads of gorgeous artwork, rough designs, and scenes during filming. And yes, four pages dedicated to Duncan Idaho \"dropping\" to Arrakis, cut from the film (shot with a stunt double and a three-story LED screen to get the reflections just right). A hardback book, this begs to be opened fully (and not resting on my sternum in bed) to view the entire thing.\n\nThe book itself is big - some 240-odd pages thick, heavy, and with a sleeve depicting the sandworm frieze from the film. A limited edition with all sorts of gubbins is available, at a substantial price. My regular edition felt expensive ($70 AUD roughly), but I believe the limited edition is more than $500 USD. \n\nHowever, this really does feel like the ultimate companion to the movie - at least until the Bluray comes out where I live and I see if it's got any \"makings of\" on it. It is damn big and thorough - there's eight pages dedicated to the ornithopters! Then the variations (Harkonnen and the one used escaping from the Nexus, nicknamed \"Orni 2\"). The text I don't feel talks enough about the writing and decisions involved - why we spend so much (welcome) time on Caladan, for instance. Instead it seems to be about designing the visuals, which is fair enough.\n\nWe do also get a shout-out to the space bagpipes too.\n\nUltimately, this is insanely high quality. I will be honest, I wasn't really entertained by the movie. I was, however, enthralled by it. It was fascinating, gobsmackingly epic, and by the time it ended I felt like I had been put through the wringer and I'll definitely buy the Bluray. I just didn't find it very enjoyable. This book, however, is a great companion to explore a lot of the little details in your own time, from other perspectives. There are a few things from the movie it missed (some of the symbolism, such as the wave of sand crashing against the rocks when Paul and Jessica encounter the sandworm), but there is so much to explore. It may seem expensive though, so be warned.\n\nIt also ends with potential glimpses of the sequel - sketches of rooms in a sietch. Definitely looks intriguing, on a scale I hadn't imagined. But it is the first few pages - artwork of a sandrider, harvester, and thopters - that impress. Through the book there are further examples which deserve a place on your walls.\n\nAs with the sense of scale in the movie itself, the sense of scale in the undertaking - filming in Norway, Budapest, Abu Dhabi, Jordan, and other places, using sandscreens, the thought put into all the props so that the universe just *feels real* - is prevalent here.\n\nThis is a premium product. It does command probably a higher price than I expected, but I did not expect a product of this quality. You certainly get what you pay for - a rich, detailed, and intimate account of the film-making process. And sometimes it's good to treat yourself."

Although as someone who lived the lives of Bene Gesserit, she seemingly is caught in the hormones of puberty unable to think clearly. Surely the Bene Gesserit have protocols to prevent such things in such a critical time in a woman's life, or the experience of the reverend mothers would help her. \n\nThe whole exchange between Hayt and Alia makes her seem totally incompetent to Hayt. I don't expect her to be omniscient, but for her to be flushed by infatuation which is implied to elude her seems wrong in light of her birth circumstances. I like the idea that Alia and Hayt complimenting each other as Alia lived the life of other before her own and Hayt is living the life of another after forgetting his own life he lived, but something about how calm and in control Hayt is in comparision to Alia being emotional really makes my eyes balls roll backwards, it comes off as r\/menwritingwomen, especially the kiss. Not to mention the earlier chapter where she is fighting in the nude.  I really don't like the sexist undertones of dune and this seems to put it over the top for me. \n\nHave I missed critical information, or misinterpreting the characters? Or this something the books explains later? I had to put the book down after this although I still plan to continue it."

If the Harkonnen have owned and controlled spice for so long why aren\u2019t they addicted or atleast the same level as Freman\/Attredes. Is this explained later? Sorry just something I thought of during all the talk with the Baron about addiction, but how is he not addicted to the spice? It\u2019s strange to me."

Anyone is welcome wether this is your first time reading the novels or if you have read them before. But don't forget to follow spoiler etiquette.\n\n\nHow does this work?\nEvery week, we will make a post to incite discussion about a chapter of Dune. This week is kind of a warm up and a heads up, since next week we discuss Chapter 1. The week after we will talk about Chapter 2. And so on until we finish the book. At this pace it will take the whole year to read the first novel, but it is ok. We want to move slowly and to take as much as we need to admire the Universe created by Mr. Herbert. If we move too slow for you, do not worry. Scout ahead, and join us at your leisure. We will take breaks on Chapters 23 and 37, as the Novel breaks itself in those chapters.\n\n\nAlso, to get some discussiones going this week, I would like to ask you. How did you first heard of Dune? For me it was my guitar teacher,  he worked last year on a Dune themed band! I have admired this guy for a long time, so his involvement in a band with Dune as a core concept made me very curious about this universe.\n\n\nThat's all from my part this week. Don't forget to get your novel in any format you like, and lets venture into the Ergs, Plains and Flats of Dune.\n\n\nThank you for your attention.\n\nSupplements:\nu\/Cool_Formal2491 pointed out the Gom Jabbar podcast has a book club series here: https:\/\/loreparty.com\/gomjabbar \nhttps:\/\/dune.fandom.com\/wiki\/Dune_Wiki\n\nP.D.

Many of you helped. Thank you! This post hasn't been updated for a while and after reading through 1000s of comments within the previous three versions of this post it seems like the two best exchanges at the moment are Binance and Coinbase. \n\nTo save you the time here is a links.  \n\nClick -->> [Binance with the maximum 20% discount trading fees permanently applied](https:\/\/accounts.binance.com\/en\/register?ref=I6RQALXK). \n\nClick -->> [Coinbase for those from the US or who want another place to buy other than Binance.](https:\/\/www.coinbase.com\/join\/man_pj0)\n\nAs requested by the community here are the same links but without the permanent discounts and\/or signup bonuses.\n\n\nClick -->> [Binance](https:\/\/www.binance.com)  \nClick -->> [Coinbase](https:\/\/www.coinbase.com)\n\n\nAfter going through the simple verification process you will now be able to buy Dogecoin and the majority of other good currencies available where you can trade, stake, sell, hold, or earn interest.

        "text": "Hello, fellow shibs. I hope y'all are holding up well in this dark times. It is okay to feel scared, when everyday your beloved doge becomes more red. But I want to remind you all that WE are not powerless. Always remember, the PEOPLE collectively decide the value of an asset by their buying and selling. Right now the PEOPLE have decided that the value of Doge is lower than last year's.\n\nBut guess what, the same PEOPLE have the power to turn the markets around if they believe in Doge's value. It is important to keep in mind that we did exactly that last year, WHY can't we do it AGAIN??We have shown before that the retail investor can shake the market more than institutions and whales can, and we very much can do so again. \n\nSo, how do we do it? Well, it's not as simple as mass buying on a specific day. That always backfires. What we can do is to not let the DOGE FLAME \ud83d\udd25 go out. A lot of people bought ads and billboards advertising doge last year, why can't we do the same now? Why can't we make Doge the household name for crypto again? Why can't we get doge trending again? Why can't we reach out to more companies to accept doge as payment again?\n\nIf you're a believer like I am, the answer to all those questions is, \"Hell yes, we can!\" \n\nPlease spread this message if you BELIEVE in the power of people!"

We all bought DOGE for good reasons to us and we must share those reasons with other people in order to continue growing. \n\nIf you're currently not running a node, maybe it's the time to do so and you can use [this guide](https:\/\/www.dogecoinisawesome.com\/full-node) for help setting up smoothly.\n\nIf you know of any exchanges that don't have DOGE, send them a message saying you want to be able to buy it there. \n\nIf you interact with businesses that want to increase revenue, ask how they feel about cryptocurrency and educate them on what they can use to accept them, like for example Bitpay.\n\nIf you know people that are looking for a new investment or want to change their relationship with money, share your knowledge and help them get started. \n\nMemes, the devs, and PR stunts like DOGE-1 will only get us so far. Last year millions of people were introduced to crypto through DOGE and we all had the power to make DOGE rise. We can do it again if we keep spreading the word and doing good every day.

They love acting like they know everything but in reality they have as much knowledge as you as no one really knows what is going to happen in the future. They change their narrative depending on the market. One they the'll send dogecoin to 1 dollar and the day after that they'll send it back to 1 cent lol. Anyways, I don't really know if these are discounted price for the near term, but i'm still holding and buying for the long term. As the long term narrative remains bullish on most of the cryptos. \nTake care, be calm and please less youtube videos \ud83d\ude05."

This is a very temporary dip that could last 1-3 months, then everything will hit an all time high again shortly after. Look at last years cycle, with inflation reports being so disgusting, people are going to be dumping cash into crypto very soon. Especially businesses. So again, only invest what you are comfortable not having liquid. Realize that your money is losing value sitting in your bank right now no matter what."

I'm almost done. Took 60k Doges to make it working and still nothing. Now even need to repay credit card and rents and can't afford it. Wake up and still have stupid hope that Doges can raise just to repay something and return to surface. Noope;) Don't want to give up, hard work mode on. Nothing. I feel sorry for me, that my only hope is, that D will someday hits 1$. Then i will repay my debts just. And show my 12 years daughter, that i'm not a total looser at my 40:("

Only greed could drive this. So don't be greedy. Sell everything and save what you have, Made the elites know you cant control us, SOLD! your cars, your houses, your lands and borrowing 10x margin to made Doge coin great again....\n\nDo I have to tell you I'm going mad?"

You would naturally see a large chunk of coin being sold in a short amount of time.     most people not realizing this  just think the house is on fire and the world is ending but I think it's the natural course of events for this situation.   This is a forced dip on top of the recent market correction and the news of the fed.    but most are just gonna set themselves on fire and jump out the window.    I  will just ride it out and see what it looks like next week month year.   PS  not financial advice just my take."

Scroll down to where you see addnode= and of course make a new entry like addnode=\"local IP of your full node\". When you start the Dogecoin core it connects to it immediately. Being on the same router\/switch it is fast. I get 4X more data from it than the other nodes it connects to. Now my poor spinning disk wallet syncs up much faster. I need a new PC. Now I am working on getting my full node to start DOGE core on boot. In the even of a power outage I only have to press the power and it start on its own. Pic of nodes screen for attention. I know I didn't need to redact my IP just habit."

        "text": "Hey everyone, it's your local chart nerd AYHS.\n\nPeople are freaking out over our most recent dip\/crash\/bear-market\/end-of-cryptocurrency\/whatever-fits-your-personal-narrative. Naturally, every time this happen, some people lose confidence in Dogecoin. This is in spite of the fact that Doge hasn't really lost value on its own, and in fact is about as strong as it was before November.\n\nToday I'm gonna teach you how to determine if Doge is down just because the market is down or if it's because Doge is losing value on its own.\n\nBuckle up and grab a snack, because there's going to be some chart-reading (though absolutely no technical analysis).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Understanding the relationship between the cryptocurrency market and Dogecoin**\n\nBefore we can actually get into how to figure out the current actual value of Doge, we need to understand the fundamentals of how we value Doge.\n\nYou see, the average person goes by the price of Doge in US Dollars. This works fine for determining how your portfolio is doing, but it doesn't really actually tell you how strong Doge is at the moment by its own merit. It's not easy to tell, from dollar value alone, if Doge is going up or down because it's doing well, or if it's doing so because the crypto market is doing well.\n\nThis is because the crypto market is strongly connected. When the crypto market is doing well, pretty much coin does well. When the crypto market is doing poorly, pretty much every coin goes down. For the record, the crypto market isn't the only one that does this; the entire stock market, for instance, tends to move together, and is the main reason we have things like the Dow Jones Industrial Average to figure out the state of the market.\n\nWe don't really have a *good* index for crypto, but we do have Bitcoin, which tends to reflect the general state of the market. What's more, Bitcoin trading pairs are the common crypto-to-crypto trading pair that isn't based on a stablecoin, such as USDT.\n\nThis is handy, because we can't trust the dollar value of a crypto to tell us the full story of a crypto's price, because all crypto is affected by the market moving as a whole. But if we judge one crypto by its price in another crypto, then we have a more accurate way of knowing how it's doing outside the influence of the wider market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo put it simply and briefly: if we want to know how Doge is *really* doing, we need to look at its price in Bitcoin, *not* USD.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So how do we actually get this information?**\n\nThere are a few sources, but any exchange place that has Dogecoin\/Bitcoin (usually listed as DOGE\/BTC) will work. Every exchange deviates a little in price, but not enough to matter for our purposes, so long as you use that exchange's prices consistently.\n\nFor the sake of making this easy and consistent, though, we're going to use [Coinmarketcap's Dogecoin charts](https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/currencies\/dogecoin\/).\n\nWhen you first pull the chart up, it's going to look like this.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yzbrac3ox5d81.png?width=943&format=png&auto=webp&s=80b600963650ba006ff3d48bd1c71b024f2490d1\n\nThis screen is kind of busy. Don't worry too much about, what you care mainly about is green and red area (the price chart), the prices in USD on the left side of the price chart, the timeframe selection in the upper right, and the two checkboxes in the lower left saying \"USD\" and \"BTC.\" You may notice a price highlighted on the left side of the screen; don't worry about that, that's just the price at the start of whatever time period you're looking at.\n\nWhat we want to do is click USD so that the checkbox is empty, then click BTC so that the checkbox is full. That will give us the following chart.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/wzvip9pby5d81.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd63a15bd6df3adede5a2fb208fadd6548a93ffa\n\nThe title in the upper left hasn't changed, but we're now looking at the Dogecoin\/Bitcoin chart. The price of a single Dogecoin listed in Bitcoin is now listed on the right. Chances are you aren't buying Dogecoin with your Bitcoin, so the numbers might seem like they don't matter to you.\n\nHowever, they do, because that number represents how much Bitcoin a single Dogecoin is worth. This is the key information we need.\n\nOne additional bit of information is helpful. If we check the USD box again and leave the BTC box checked, we can see the DOGE\/USD and DOGE\/BTC charts together.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zssdrbfiz5d81.png?width=955&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c32dd4e9cb559c1b0cda746d74122a2632dc169\n\nI'll explain why this is helpful exactly in a moment but being able to see this at a glance makes figuring out what's happening with Doge easier. Note, though, that on Coinmarketcap, when you show USD and BTC together, the yellow line is DOGE\/BTC, and the other line is DOGE\/USD. It will be green or red depending on where the price is at the end of the timeframe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Alright, AYHS, what exactly do I** ***do*** **with all this information?**\n\nWell, we can do a few things.\n\nWe're going to shift gears for a moment and use the past 3 months as an example. You can choose that timeframe using the buttons in the upper right.\n\nFirst, we're going up look at the DOGE\/USD chart.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/59eynt7f06d81.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=f007aa6b4b612e5ed3e37f7464d3b7487f871371\n\nLooks kind of dire, doesn't it? That helpful indicator says that back in October we were at $0.25, and now we're at $0.14. That's nearly half what it used to be, so Dogecoin must be dying, right?\n\nNot exactly. To prove that, we're going to look at the 3 Month DOGE\/BTC chart.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/exits7gz06d81.png?width=938&format=png&auto=webp&s=539140530d05eec6da4c5a401c05b322c336c8bb\n\nYou need to squint a little at it, and it's best if you pull the chart up on your own. But this chart is a lot more horizontal. There's a period in late October to mid-December that the price seems to go down, but for the most part it's nearly the same. The very beginning of this chart has the Bitcoin price of a single Dogecoin at 0.00000400 (or, 400 Satoshis) The lowest it goes is around 0.00000330 (330 Satoshis), which around 82.5% of what it is at the start of that chart. That's still a drop of 17.5%, but nowhere nearly as bad as the near half you get if you just look at DOGE\/USD.\n\nWhat's more, at the time of writing, the price of DOGE\/BTC is nearly what it was three months ago. It's slightly lower - by about 10 Satoshis - but it's nearly the same.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Wait, AYHS, I'm confused. How can Doge's US dollar value have gone down so much, but the price in Bitcoin stayed close to the same?**\n\nBecause, as I stated earlier, the *entire market is connected*. Dogecoin hasn't gone down in the past three months because Dogecoin is losing value; it's gone down because the entire market is going down. And we can see that just by looking at Bitcoin.\n\nHere's Coinmarketcap's Bitcoin chart for the past 3 months:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/i3ys9wad36d81.png?width=947&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a2b72df41e2e1e0fb7bcae79c0019f208e503f2\n\nWe've been on a steady downward trend. Now compare that to a combined chart of DOGE\/USD and DOGE\/BTC.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/fkv7sf6n36d81.png?width=956&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8fbea4eec687b5cfa0c0e69cc9a55067ea28c7e\n\nNote how Dogecoin trends downward on USD, but every time it takes a jump in price in USD, so does the DOGE\/BTC chart. That's because that reflects times Dogecoin *itself* has changed in value, and so gotten more valuable compared to Bitcoin. Doge's value in BTC does decrease in places, but the percentage it moves on the DOGE\/BTC chart doesn't line up with its movements on the DOGE\/USD chart, indicating that its drop in USD value is due to the market declining, not Doge itself.\n\nYou can do this with any coin, in fact. As an example, here's a chart of LUNA\/USD and LUNA\/BTC over the past 3 months.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/fg2nchac46d81.png?width=937&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbf28663deb7c3b9a94066084ea92f4888d808c4\n\nTerra (LUNA) was newsworthy for a bit because it was soaring in USD price while the rest of the market wasn't doing very hot. And you can see LUNA gaining value in the above graph. You can also see its USD price dropping but its price in BTC staying in roughly the same area, indicating that recent declines in LUNA's price are due to the market declining, not LUNA on its own.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So what's the point of knowing all this, for the average Shibe?**\n\nBecause this information is how you know if Doge is truly dying. At the time of writing this, the price of Doge is \\~$0.14. That's the lowest it's been since we hit the $0.70 ATH. And, I'm gonna be honest with you, there's no reason to believe Doge won't be going lower.\n\nBut, armed with this information, we can tell with objectivity that Doge's current decline isn't because of Doge itself, but instead due to the entire market declining. We can also tell when Doge is gaining in price because the market is moving up, and when it's gaining in price because Doge itself is gaining in value.\n\nThere's also value for speculation, but I'm going to spoil it because this post is mostly meant for education.\n\n>!DOGE\/BTC price history has us in entirely new territory; prior to 2021, we always ranged between around 15 and 150 satoshis. We haven't dropped below 300 satoshis since 2021, despite a couple short bear markets, general negative sentiment, and Doge's own history being that drops back into the sub-100-satoshi territory within a year of every spike.!<\n\n>!It also tends to return to its previous BTC highs, especially during bull markets. That means that the next spike, coinciding with another bull market, will likely push us above $1 and beyond.!<\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR\/Bottom Line**\n\nThe best way to evaluate how Doge is currently doing is to look at the Doge\/BTC charts. The Doge\/USD charts can and will mislead, as they're influenced by the general state of the market and don't give the full picture on what a coin's current actual value is without the influence of the crypto market's general insanity."

I have 1 number tattooed on me on my left hand and i\u2019m dressed in a outfit i don\u2019t remember owning. I somehow run into my best friend that I was relieved to see because I knew we\u2019ll find a way out. I found a tunnel in the side of the wall and slid down it. It took me to this huge futuristic arena with a multiple people in the same outfit as me but the people in here had all 3 numbers tattooed on their hands and i had 1. There was a guy with a suit that was speaking to everyone through a loud speaker. All i remember him saying is \u201cJust let it go, this is our new home. There\u2019s nothing out there for us anymore\u201d and somehow he found me without the numbers and sent me back up. As soon as I got back I told my best friend that it\u2019s way bigger than we thought and we need to get out of that house. He believes me and goes to another room to try to get out and my sister shows up. I tell her the same thing so we go to a room in our house with a already broken window and as soon as we open it and i stick my legs out a very transparent but scary looking demon entity came and put his hand out using some invisible force pulling me back in. I started screaming Jesus Christ over and over before the demon gives up and i fly out the window waking me up in real life. This scared me so bad"

        "text": "\\*This is my pre-totally done with the show summary-stance. \n\nEpisodes 1-3 are my favorite. Some shows increase energy and tension after, I don't see that with Squid Game. It's still a great show. I like 90% of it \u2013 and love 50% of it. \n\n\\*I would've liked if say 16 or maybe 2 at least and not -only one- player won out. Eliminating all but one was implied\/stated but it felt way too extreme.\n\nI admired the simple \"smash all\" games more than the skill and chaotic games -- with a lower chance of failure outright but a huge test against lower skill players. To me \"this game is said to be Fair... but not so deep down, it really isn't fair and it's Darwinism.\" \n\nI was surprised the thug guy did not make it farther, but his doom was oddly appeasing. I would have made a lot more emotional and mental growth in the characters. It was all drama in some ways, but it did have substance and a Lot of style. \n\nOverall, I'd call SG 9.5\/10. It's a good show. It is good despite its callous murderous mentality. To me the violence is great but leans towards \"more excess than impactful.\" Of course I'd have made a smaller group (say 200) and in all due Equality decided a plural winner circle (who could elect one final round for WTA.) ... It is what it is, and made no real turns or negative twists. Predictable, forceful, and a little insane to the end. \n\nSeriously though... what did you like, what did you not like, what would you've done differently? I really like the out-of-game scenes and real world dramas too, as much as most of the Games. But this is a great show, it focuses plenty on the competition and in the right ways. I think I'm still a bit whelmed by the show, and some of the character deaths. ..  I hope we shall have more."

Stole money from his congregation?  Messed with some people he shouldn\u2019t have messed with? I don\u2019t think he  left willingly because he\u2019s seems very religious in the games.\n\nAs  a believer in the faith myself I don\u2019t mind him quoting verses out of  context in inappropriate situations; that\u2019s nothing new under the sun.\n\nHe  kind of reminds me of that retarded American church where the believers  played with live poisonous snakes because the Bible says His believers  can be bitten by poisonous snakes and survive. He thinks just because  he\u2019s a believer he has some sort of get-out-of-jail-free card.\n\nIt\u2019s  interesting the way he justifies killing people using scriptures from  the Bible, but it\u2019s the Bible we\u2019re talking about; if you look hard  enough and twist words to suit your own intepretations, you could  probably find any scripture to justify doing anything considered a sin,  or as the Bible would call it, a *wrongdoing*.\n\nIt\u2019s actually quite impressive how he remained religious till the very end, still praying when he was pushed off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/abyw0fvli6d81.png?width=416&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3a72807db8415a844441f978cac8554a9849403\n\nTo be honest, in real life I wouldn\u2019t have considered him a true believer. It\u2019s almost ***always*** the least religious people that snap into ultra religious mode when they\u2019re in danger, or should I say *in the face of peril*.  Most real Christians would be much more calm, thinking \u201cmy life is in  His hands now, if it is in His plans that I survive I will\u201d.\n\nI like the pastor, he's amusing."

Then Sae Byeok starts to really fucking bleed and Gi hun is distraught and bangs on the doors tp get help. Sang woo goes over to Sae Byeok and ends her life there, leaving Gi hun alive. You had one averagely built guy who is relatively unhurt and angry at you, and a girl who was alreayd bleeding out, why wouldn't you run over to a completely distracted Gi hun and slice his neck first, leaving yourself with Sae Byeok to compete against in the end. Yes, I realize, sure, maybe he doesn't want to kill his friend, yadda. But given Sang Woo was 2 people away from winning, Gi hun's back was towards him (so less shame in killing his friend without having to look at him), it was really like a 20 second thing. It just struck me as entirely odd that this is the moment sang woo chose to have feelings, only to have to battle against the dude in the end anyway. He could have won it all even before game 6 starts. His explanation that Gi hun was going to end the game to save the girl doesn't make sense as ending Gi hun's life would have accomplished the same thing."

Most likely before or after the games have taken place as we know he wouldn't purposely end someone's life. It would be quite cool to see a cinematic of Gi-hun escaping the facility as a bomb explodes behind him and shots of each room being blown up. It would be a bit disappointing as that could end it on Season 2 but it could also be delayed until a future Season like 3 or anymore they may do. We also see that the bomb has a countdown on it as we can see the faded 88:88 like on any other clock. It's unknown whether or not milliseconds are the :\\_\\_ , seconds or even minutes but I'd assume that it is Minutes:Seconds\n\ntell me what u think. will gi-hun blow up the entire facility? how much legal trouble lmao? would there then be a next season\/episode after that showing what happens to the facility after being blown up? and what flaws are there with the theory ( a lot )?"

Some shows have a great first season but just can't replicate the magic afterwards.\n\nI would say a second season can't just be a carbon copy of the first where we follow a group of players throughout the game.  Some new elements need to be added to make it different.\n\nPersonally, I would like to see a second season focus more on the people who have to do the dirty work.  How are they recruited?  What training to do they get?  How do they feel about murdering game contestants when they lose?  Do they work only one season or are they bound by a multiyear contract?  From the little we see in season 1, we know that the lot of the pink tracksuit workers is not that great.  Their living quarters are small and rather spartan.  They are almost as expendable as the contestants, should any of their faces be exposed.  Some of them are disgruntled enough that they set up an organ harvesting side hustle to make some money.\n\nFrom what we can glean from the organization behind the games, there are layers of oppression and exploitation that can be a gold mine for a future season to explore.\n\nWhat would the rest of you like to see in a second or additional future seasons?"

There's no mention of this short scene online anywhere, and at first I thought it was a three-fingered salute but it seems to just be a normal one.\n\nThe only reason I can figure is because 276 is a Fillipino man and Ali is a Pakistani man, so they're both minorities in the contestant population.

After all, how is it possible that only men chose the red cards or came back to the game when the organization targets both men and women? \n\nAdditionally, some other clues include their familiarity with firearms and killing, having no emotions and hesitation when it comes to violence, and even being somewhat messed up in the head (one guard mentioned raping the corpse of a dead female player)\u2026I think we can at least agree that those guys are not ordinary citizens who applied, and all of them must share some kind of a background.

        "text": "When people talk about the worst person in Squid Game, we frequently see Oh Il-Nam or Cho Sang-woo mentioned. However, there's one villain I feel is underestimated in terms of evil; Jang Deok-su.\n\nThe first thing to specify; heinous and evil are two different things. Villains like Il-Nam, In-ho (the Front man) and VIP's are obviously more heinous due to worse actions but they have way more resources to work with than Deok-su. Doing worse actions than someone doesn't make you more evil.\n\nFor me, someone truly evil is a sadistic psychopath who knows that they are doing is wrong and actively strives to hurt others with no redeeming or sympathetic qualities. Let's look at the other villains;\n\nOh Il-Nam - Started the Squid Games out of boredom, making him responsible for thousands of deaths. However, he genuinely liked Gi-Hun as a friend as he admitted in his final moments, from the way he talks of them he clearly loves his family, there's nothing that indicates his affable, friendly nature is an act and he voted to let everyone leave when it came down to his vote. Il-Nam, while causing the most harm, isn't sadistic or cruel for the sake of it and has redeeming qualities. Plus at his age, think about the amount of wars and economic issues he's witnessed or suffered. Can you blame him for his bad view on humanity (doesn't justify his actions though)?\n\nFront Man - Oversees the games, kills guards for removing their masks and even shoots his own brother (doubt he's dead though). However, he clearly was hesitant and regretted doing the latter, he has genuine respect for Il-Nam (visits his death bed), is against cheating and likely has a sympathetic background (seeing as he was in a situation where he played the games himself).\n\nCho Sang-woo - Lol Sang-woo worse than Deok-su? Sang-woo did do bad stuff during the game; not telling about the second game, tricking Ali, (accidentally) pushing 69 to suicide, pushing the glassmaker and killing Say-byeok. However, Sang-woo takes no pleasure in any of his actions and clearly shows remorse of most of them. Unlike Deok-su, none of his actions are out of malice, he's just acting to survive. He even redeems himself in the end, sacrificing himself so Gi-Hun can get the prize money and help his mother.\n\nAll of of the other major villains, despite their flaws, have positive qualities (the VIP's are a group and don't have much individual personality so I don't count them). \n\nDeok-su? Beats a girl in his first scene while making racist remarks, beats a man to death over a bottle, instigates a riot to cull as many weaker players as possible, takes sadistic glee (rather than Il-Nam's childish glee) in murdering others in tug of war, laughs at 69's suicide and then cowardly threatens to get everyone killed in the glass game despite having threatened to push the ones in front of him beforehand.\n\nWhile all of the villains are despicable human beings and there are no excuse for their actions, Deok-su is the only one who's actually a Chaotic Evil sadist and sociopath with no redeeming qualities. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions but these are my reasons for why I believe the worst, most evil person in Squid Game is Jang Deok-su."

If the deaths are on schedule, the players will be given games like red light green light where hypothetically every player could survive, however if too many people are left, the players will be assigned to games like tug of war where no matter what only 1\/2 of the players can make it, these games significantly reduce the player count and thus help keep narrowing down the potential winners to only 1 person.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that if everyone made it through the glass challenge, the next game might have instead been some kind of free-for-all game where only one person can win."

        "text": "When I watched the first episode I struggled understanding why the organisers would let the games end if the majority of the participants voted so. The risk is that after all the money and effort put to recruit and organise the games, the majority would leave and not return, and all the money would go to the families of the people died. They could recruit more people after that but still, all the money would go.\nI understand wanting the majority of people being motivated to stay (I mean, staying alive is a pretty good motivation already).\n\nBut what I really can\u2019t wrap my head around is why Oh ll-nam would vote to leave knowing his was the decisive vote. He already had 50% of the people wanted to stay so why risking everything?\nOne could say he wants to gamble to make thing even more interesting but, hey, he is participating in a game he could actually die in. Isn\u2019t that enough? \nWhat are your thoughts?"

        "text": "\\*Sharp Inhale\\*  \n\n\nNumber 1 Ggabanu: This is a very moving episode with the emotional deaths of Ali, Ji-Yeong and (kinda) Il nam. This is also the only episode to only be focused on the game nothing else, witch makes it special.\n\nNumber 2 Hell: When though some may consider this episode on their bottom I say it\u2019s one of the best in the series. The foreshadowing of each players death is incredibly smart. I also believe introducing the characters in episode 1 only to show their plights in Episode 2 was incredibly genius.\n\nNumber 3 The man with the umbrella: Ok I do admit I have a soft spot for this episode. 212 and 067s chemistry wowed me. Honeycomb is likely one of the best executed games in the series. It planted the seeds for Sang woos true morality very early. The game gives me the the feeling of eeriness the most. It\u2019s hard to put into words. It just encapsulates the feel of squid game perfectly for me. How the names of the dead are slowly listed out.\n\nNumber 4 Red light,Green light: This episode gives us a good look at Gi hun that I think only episode 9 and 8 do and this episode does it better then them. The struggles of Gi Huns life are surprisingly fun to watch. The game itself does feel very eerie and defiantly by design is the cruelest game of the bunch, the players walked into death, and they didn\u2019t even know.\n\nNumber 5 Frontman: This episode is easily the most character driven of the bunch. The chemistry between the final 3 in impeccable. We\u2019ve really gotten to know these characters though out the last 7 episodes and 067s death is very moving. The scene with The detective and frontman on the cliff is also pretty surprising. Even if it felt like a cheap twist.  \n\nNumber 6 A fair world: This episode mostly follows 3 plot lines The detective doing whatever, the main cast chilling and the Doctor being killed. This episodes pacing feels alike to a sitcom with A plots B plots and C plots. Which doesn\u2019t fit the show the greatest. These plot lines are all very decent and the speech about a fair world is one of my favorite scenes.\n\nNumber 7 Last stand: This episode leaves a lot to be desired. The ending with Sang woo and Gi hun is amazing but it leaves the rest of the episode feeling aimless and poorly paced. The twist with Il nam feeling contrived and the talk while important lore wise only presented points that were already said in earlier episodes.\n\nNumber 8 Stick to a team: This episode is split into to half\u2019s like episodes like 1 or 3 but this episode doesn\u2019t pull it off nearly as well as the other 2. It leaves the episode feeling split in two and scatterbrained. I also believed this was the only episode without something to say just we play game fight pepole tug of war. The lights out secne was all very disorienting. \n\nNumber 9 V.I.P\u2019s: This episode is on a lot of people bottom list because of the vips in general like their juvenile humo. My main problem with this episode thoguh is the execution of glass bridge\n\nPlease dicuss you own opinions in the comments."

I'm super happy there's going to be another season, then hopefully some questions can be answered :) Sorry to ramble!"

Im sure at least 2 reports of this exact same thing possibly from different parts of the country would raise an eyebrow from the police. And there would definitely be more than 2 people who reported it so they would eventually go \"actually today multiple people reported that exact thing\".\n\nALSO There were other squidgames in the past. And you're telling me that none of them had the exact) situation as voting to leave and reporting it to the police? Wouldn't they notice the reports they get of murderous child games on the same date every year?\n\nSo I think the front man or even >!Il-nam!< could have bribed the police into ignoring all reports of it\n\nEdit: before anyone says \"What about Jun-ho (the detective)\n\nIts possible that only the police chiefs are informed and whenever a normal officer is told they tell the police chief and they just dismiss it. However, in Jun-ho's case his brother went missing and he found the same card with the shapes on it that he saw gi-hun had. which led to him doing his own investigation without police permission"

Even worse, as the episode showed, the impact might not even kill you and you will still be conscious, feeling every broken bone and damaged organ in your body as you slowly dies. \n\nI know you die the same way in the glass stepping-stone game, but at least you have the element of surprise in that game. In Tug-of-war, you can SEE your death coming as your feet began to slip and you get dragged towards your doom. That\u2019s way more terrifying than a sudden death!\n\nand finally, this also one the hardest one to strategize since you\u2019re not given much time to think of a plan and it\u2019s more difficult to do so when you\u2019re on the ropes. You can\u2019t stay calm and you\u2019re in constant panic mode!"

However, I can't find any mention of it on reddit or any other article, so maybe I am missing something.\n\nIn the finale, there is a flashback to a scene with the Front Man and the old man taking his mask off, just as the VIPs arrive. The dialogue is revealed:\n\nOld man: \"And our guests, greet them for me, all right?\"\n\nFront man: \"Of course, sir, but why not do it yourself?\"\n\nOld man: \"**Because I know that I'm not going to have as much fun watching as playing.**\"\n\nThis line makes no sense. If you go back, that scene happens right after the VIPs arrive and right after the marbles game has ended. I get that the old man didn't get shot at the end of the marbles game and made his way to the VIP area. But that line makes no sense. He's already been eliminated. He has nothing to play. He doesn't play anything after that scene. That line makes no sense, and should not make any sense to the Front Man. \n\nIf this is just a terrible translation, then what **is** the real reason the old man says he can't greet the guests?"

In the dystopian world of Robocop, life has zero value and people are killed without remorse or due process in a very similar way in Squid Game. \n\nRobocop touched more on themes of policing, unions, corporate greed, the ethical dilemma of AI and technology in society, real estate development, etc... But the cut scenes with the TV commercials like for NUKE'EM and just the absurdity of the world in Robocop seems similar to that in Squid Game.\n\nAnd then Starship Troopers touches on luck\/chance and class struggle\/class privilege which are also very obvious themes of Squid Game. Starship Troopers also highlights the futility of war and irony of loyalty to your \"tribe\" in a globalized world.\n\nAnyways, I'm not looking for anyone to agree or disagree, but just an observation.

But they could easily use them, make parallels and plan a bit for the rest of the games. They managed to figure out that the hosts were twisting children's games for the event: couldn't they look around at what was on the walls and guess based on their childhood games?

While I don\u2019t believe it is ever explicitly stated he is Muslim, I think it can be reasonably inferred based on his name, him being from Pakistan, his wife wearing a head scarf, etc.\n\nHis argument: Ali is a bad depiction of a Muslim. He is in the Squid Game because his morals are poor, he doesn\u2019t mind being in a game where people are killed en masse,  he returns to the game willingly. Ultimately, he argues that Ali didn\u2019t need to be Muslim - but he was intentionally made so to negatively depict them.\n\nMy thoughts: I disagree. The same argument could be made about every participant in the Squid Game, and that overlooks the varied backgrounds each of them have. In Ali\u2019s case, he is a migrant worker trying to support his family, being snuffed from pay by his boss. Plus, I feel Ali is one of the most \u201cgood\u201d or at least sympathetic characters. He saves Gi-hun in the first challenge. The only time he \u201ckills\u201d someone is tug-of-war where he has to and was part of a team. He is so nice and caring that it ultimately becomes his downfall as Sang-woo takes advantage of him.\n\nWas curious what others thought? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an argument that should be dismissed automatically, but I know there is a population of people who kinda look for stuff to be offended by - and I feel this might be part of that."

I know it wouldn't have added to the story much because Gi-han was already angry with his friend, but Ali was a character we grew to like and to not have his story be told, esp when he has a wife and child out there which the show even took the time to depict, makes it really bitter. Anyway, interested to hear your thoughts!"

Season 2 would basically be a \u201cprequel\u201d to season 1. And then season 3 would pick up where season 1 left off. We now know that S2 is still following the events S1. BUT Netflix is apparently working on an Animated movie as well!- with a \u201cwhole new group of players\u201d- so I\u2019m thinking that this Animated movie will be a prequel to Season 1, we will see."

Being the host, he is well researched about Sang Woo and knows his career history. If he had given up his name Il Nam, it is very likely Sang Woo would have recognized it as he also had a career in finance.\n\nShow is awesome, there's so many little things woven in to notice."

(I have some but wanted to see what other people think)\n\nEdit: might have to clarify more. Plotholes that would make people think the show is bad. Im not unfamiliar with any criticism of the show. Stuff like the bad twist at the end is something even people who love the show hate. Iive talked to people who say its bad or doesnt make sense with either a weak or no explanation. So I wondered what serious plotholes might be in the show"

I'm a Danganronpa fan so I'm used to people getting deep-fried, bludgeoned, hanged, impaled, stabbed, stampede'd, squished, burned, turned into butter, by comparison in SG they just get shot and sometimes they fall. I haven't seen Gomorrah so I can't really compare but still."

So, I decided to start watching it one night and...\n\nI literally watch the entire thing in one viewing. It was one of the best viewing experiences I ever had and I was so hooked on its unique concept.\n\nThis show was such a rollercoaster (in a good way)! The acting was phenomenal and the great performances really pulled at my heart strings. I got attached to the characters and their emotional backstories. I think I even caught myself shedding tears when the North Korean girl died.\n\nThe show is also surprisingly extremely underrated from a cinematography standpoint. Everything was so colorful and vibrant, which made it easier to follow what was going on (why are so many shows so dark these days?).\n\nMaybe this is an unpopular opinion but I thought it was one of the best shows of the year. I feel like it was so much more authentic than the other original Netflix shows I watched recently, apart from maybe Stranger Things.\n\nI know most people have already watched this fantastic series, but I had to rant about it! I am thinking about watching it again soon to catch everything that I missed like all the little Easter eggs and foreshadowing."

        "text": "This theory is kind of a stretch, to say the least, but I do think it holds some weight\n\nThe Pink Soldier's theme is not just a song the viewers hear, rather, it is something that actually hypnotizes the guards when it plays. I have several pieces of supporting evidence for this.\n\n1. We only hear the theme when we can see a guard's mask with one exception (that being the first time we hear it).\n2. In the scene where the guards go out into the hallway for roll call when the song plays, a guard on the left side instantly straightens his back.\n3. There's no time that a guard ever speaks while the theme plays (that I can remember anyway)\n4. The voice changer clearly tells us there's some kind of electronics suite in the mask.\n5. The frame of the mask is definitely big enough to hold some sort of micro-speaker on each side.\n6. Guards seem relatively collected in life-threatening situations with the mask on, yet when they take the mask off and are staring death in the face, they are trembling in fear."

First thing having gotten there they were basically drugged and kidnapped and then they wake up somewhere that resembles prison.\n\nIt's here they are given the chance to refuse and leave, or they may sign the contract. As far as movies and shows with death traps goes, that's given fair warning and plenty of chance to get out ahead of time. Not saying that makes it right, but they at least had gotten a good idea about the brutality of the process they were in. I feel sort of better about it since I know I'd have gotten my ass way out of there, and I feel good watching scenarios play out where I think I could survive in one piece!"

        "text": "As I follow this sub and read all the interesting theories about this monumental show, I had something that came to mind about the early Squid Games. As far as I know, this has never been talked about.\n\nIn the scene where Jun-Ho goes into the secret room to look for information about his brother, in one of the documents is the list of winners. From that we see that the games have been running annually since 1988. For one thing we know that Hwang In-Ho (the current Front Man) won the 2015 games.\n\nOther than the fact that the winners are documented, and perhaps even the number of players (like several hundred) who participated, anything else about the games before 2019 is a mystery.\n\nThis led me to wonder whether the games back in those years were the same as in the current edition. But here's one reason to be skeptical about that idea. *Of course, this is completely speculative.*\n\n**Maybe the games weren't as deadly before as they are now.** Otherwise, I would imagine in some of the previous years, the games would go on similar to today's edition, that is people don't know what they will play, only to find out that losing means death, then a handful of players (temporarily) quit the game. With a few hundred leaving in the middle of the game, it's highly probable that given what they have witnessed, the police would have been alerted those times. So the police would be aware of some mysterious thing going on annually and would likely have cracked down on it given the 30+ years they had. How did the games become so deadly? Perhaps at some point, the Front Man or the VIPs found the previous editions too boring and wanted to add violent action so it becomes more thrilling for the VIPs.\n\nPlease comment below if you have any other ideas about what the previous squid games might have been like."

(Market competition is somehow analogous to competing in the games.)\n\nWith regard to theory A: People joined the games either because they owed money to the mob (or in Kang Sae-byeok's case, to smuggle her mom out of North Korea.) But North Korea is socialist, so it doesn't help with the critique of capitalism, and I'm pretty sure the mob could exist in a socialist society too.\n\nSo that leaves the games themselves (theory B). Is people getting shot supposed to represent being poor in modern-day society? Mr. Beast's version of the games seems like a better comparison to capitalism because the people who lose don't get shot but if you win you still get money. The games = capitalism angle seems like a stretch, but the director said the show is supposed to represent capitalism. So is it A or B or both?"

        "text": "Did a quick search and didn't see this particular method shown, so apologies if others mention this. Note also this does not assume that quirks like the rails holding up the plates are allowed to be used (there are automatic rifles like in red light\/green light possibly placed for people trying it). \n\nThe rules assume that EVERYONE must go in the numerical order they picked. Each pair of plates either breaks upon stepping on it (no cheating such as using clothing\/shoe sledge weights), or it can hold the weight of at least two players.  \n\nNote that there was no rule that people had keep going until they died before the next person went. That safe plates can hold at least two people point to the best way to play.\n\nBasically, EVERYONE must risk death at 50\/50 chance in order of rotation. Player 1 picks a plate. If it's safe, then player 1 stays on that plate while player 2 steps on it for the next guess. If player 1 falls, player 2 must still risk 50\/50 on the next set of plates. Player 3 follows behind, again risking 50\/50 but this time on the 3rd set of plates.\n\nWhen it's the 16th player's turn, they are stepping on plates with people on it (meaning the unbroken plates are dangerous), or on empty plates (previous player dropped). After that, the first two players that survived must leave their plates to risk one more time (sorry, luck of the draw on that).  \n\nIf done right, I'd assume 7 of the 16 players should survive on average. In addition, as it's not \"certain death\" for the person going first, then all players would be more willing to risk at least one jump knowing that another goes right after them. Obviously SDE McChickenShit would still screw up things but that's drama for you."

Who would bet their lives unless it was Bill  Gates level $ involved? And they didn't even know there would be only one winner out of 456 people. Imagine splitting that among say 10 finalists, and then it's 3.8 million, which goes by faster than you think (I remember the winner of Survivor won a million or something and said you really go through it fast).

Those types of games would've been around after war. \n\nTug-of-war? Sure, that probably could've been around Grandpa Gganbu's time, but not really specific ones like squid game or the sugar disc game, my dad says. \n\nAlso worth noting, but in real life, my dad would do that sugar cutout game. You start off with simpler shapes, and if successful, the vendor gives you another sugar disc for free, but with an harder shape to cut out.

I actually thought this was what happened, and was surprised that Jun-ho left him alive, considering he killed one of the staff earlier.\n\nThis, of all the things Jun-Ho could've done, had the best chance of screwing over the Front Man and derailing the games. The Front Man would've gotten in huge trouble for his incompetence, and probably would have been fired or killed. The VIPs would've run away, terrified of the maniac running around trying to kill them. The game would be ruined at this point. The Front Man got the boot and the audience is gone."

        "text": "At the heart of Squid Game is **\"the old man\"** (**Il-nam Oh**; Korean: \uc624\uc77c\ub0a8) He is the mastermind behind the game and represents **the Central Banking System and the IMF**, organizations that lend money to nations which puts them in lifelong debt. He is Player 001 and everything begins and ends with him. \n\n**Gi-hun Seong**  (Korean: \uc131\uae30\ud6c8) represents the rise of **South Korea** from a poor fishing village of the 1950s to its current status as an economic power whose GDP is 10th in the world. \n\n**Sae-byeok Kang** (Korean: \uac15\uc0c8\ubcbd) represents **North Korea**. Gi-hun wanted to leave the Squid Game together with Sae-byeok and this symbolic union represents the mutual wishes of the two Koreas: North and South to finally reunify\n\n**Sang-woo Cho** (Korean: \uc870\uc0c1\uc6b0) represents **Japan** and its genius intellect in the development of its science and technology sectors. The nation was on its way to become the #1 superpower before it took a gamble and signed the Plaza Accord in 1985, which offset its own currency in favor of the US dollar, leading to a decades long economic depression. Sang-woo, like Japan has the largest in debt in the world. Currently, it has approximately $11.63 trillion in national debt and rising. \n\n**Ali Abdul** (Korean: \uc54c\ub9ac \uc555\ub458) represents **Pakistan**. Japan has a special relationship with Pakistan and this is symbolized by the friendship between Sang-woo and Ali. \n\n**Deok-su Jang** (Korean: \uc7a5\ub355\uc218) represents **Russia**. The gangster style leadership is often correlated with Russian politics in which corruption is seen as the norm. They utilize their show of military strength in order to intimidate the other nations in the near vicinity, often using aggressive language in which they say they will use their weapons against other nations if necessary. \n\n**Mi-nyeo Han** (Korean: \ud55c\ubbf8\ub140) represents **China**. The Han Chinese currently are the ruling group in Chinese politics. Her character is seen as manipulative and sneaky, attempting to partner with all the surrounding players, especially with Deok-su, who represents Russia. She screams out in S1:E6 during the Marbles game that it would be a mistake not to partner with her and that everyone will be sorry. This is much the same indignant sentiment China often expresses in the media when nations choose not to participate in China's One Road One Belt project or any other initiative China undertakes. However, China always somehow survives and gets the last word. If Russia doesn't partner with China, China knows exactly how to take Russia down as evident in S1:E7 during the Glass Bridge game when Mi-nyeo takes down Deok-su and they fall together through the glass. \n\n**The Front Man** (In-ho Hwang; Korean: \ud669\uc778\ud638) represents **South Korean chaebols**, such as Samsung in which its technology is the power behind the US military. Its omnipresent, all seeing power knows just about everything about everyone. \n\n**The Squid Game soldiers** represent the **CIA.** Some of them are secretly profiting from selling human organs on the black market (such as the dead squid game soldiers). The CIA has been said to have enormous control and authority over local death squads in multiple nations and been criticized to encourage and promote torture by continuous payments and by shielding perpetrators from all legal and political consequences. The CIA and the Central Banking System work in conjunction with each other. \n\n**The Doctor** (Byeong-gi, Korean: \ubcd1\uae30) represents nations such as **Iraq and Libya.** Their nations benefited from alliance with the US, and the CIA trained their entire military and equipped them with US weapons before these Middle Eastern nations began to go against US foreign policy and bypass the Central Banking System which lead to their public executions. In Korean, [\ubbf8\uc0ac\uc77c \ubcd1\uae30](https:\/\/www.wordhippo.com\/what-is\/the-meaning-of\/korean-word-5b196a5479c5f228cfd3bf912448100667295b20.html) (name of the doctor) means missile. \n\nQUESTION: Which nation\/organizations do you think **The Police Detective** (Jun-ho Hwang; Korean: \ud669\uc900\ud638) represents?"

I honestly haven't felt this way about a show since I watched the Wire for the first time.\n\nAnyways I noticed that in episode 7,  while the last 3 players were eating the \"prize meal\" the camera cuts to the chase between the guards and the infiltrating police.\n\nKeep in mind, at this time, it is already pretty obvious that Sae-byeok's end is near due to her injury from the glass shards. What I find interesting is how her \"end\" is framed.\n\nOnly AFTER  the camera pans to her do we switch scenes to the chase of the police officer. Whats interesting is how the police officer esccapes: he swims across a body of water. This is very similar to how she described her escape from North Korea and from what I understand, is how most Noth Korean defectors escape. \n\nI'm not to sure, but I think the police officer's escape was meant to mirror her journey or to signal the end of her journey because a lot of character's stories seem to be cyclical (ex, Ali). \n\nAnother interpretation may be that it is meant to show that no matter how had she tries, she is still running, the authortarian powers of the ruling class are too powerful for her.\n\nI know this might be a reach but I couldn't help but notice how weird it was that they only cut to the chase after focusing the camera on her. Maybe a few people already pointed this out but I haven't had time to go through this sub completely yet lol. \n\nRegardless, its a great example of detailed storytelling, I'm a sucker for a show that puts so much thought into its characters."

I also think it was to waste time so less people were around, therefore less were likely to see that he never got shot. And all this had to happen in this fake house, obviously built just for him, where the walls concealed him.\n\nPerhaps an obvious theory, but there you go."

Both wounds were non-lethal by the symmetry of them (being that front man was able to dig it out without too much trouble).  That makes me think that the cop, as little brother, could take up the next front man position.  There's no way that the cop's character exits the series this early lol."

He chose to let Gi-hun take the umbrella despite recognizing the game in \"The Man with the Umbrella,\" he betrayed Ali who would have won the marbles fair and square otherwise in \"Gganbu,\" he pushed the glassmaker to his death in \"VIPs,\" and he killed Sae-byeok in \"Front Man\" *specifically because* he feared Gi-hun would team up with her to terminate the games and leave them all empty-handed.\n\nSo why does he defy *all of that* by sacrificing himself to let Gi-hun take the money? Better yet, he was already trying to kill Gi-hun, so when the protagonist's guard was down, **couldn't Sang-woo have just taken the knife out of the dirt and go for Gi-hun?** It just makes no sense to me that he would put this much effort into being in it to win it only for him to throw it away.\n\nI'm sure there is a valid reason for him taking his life that I am missing, and I honestly really appreciate it in the plot, and it was an emotional roller coaster watching it for the first time (when he stabbed his own neck, I genuinely gasped so loudly that my dad looked at me funny). Don't get me wrong, I think it was really good for the series and I love Squid Game, but how does it fit Sang-woo's character?"

        "text": "In the South Korean series Squid Game, players compete with each other and put their lives at risk for a cash prize at the expense of their dignity and humanity, often deteriorating the bonds of trust between family, friends and close colleagues.\n\nThis breakdown of trust ensures that what people value above all else is the cash prize at the end while the elites at the top of the game, play with people's lives and casually bet one player against another in a form of entertainment detached from empathy and human bonds.\n\nAt the heart of this series is *the promotion of a perverse type of democracy:* The Front Man declares that all players are equal and have an equal chance at winning the prize and that is one of the fundamental characteristics of the game. However, the game is anything but a game between equals, instead it is designed so that all the players will ultimately lose their lives, in a similar fashion to the torture fascists inflicted onto their people in the early 20th century. **The new fascism is the form of neoliberal economics, a perverted type of neoliberal capitalism in which the majority of the people are under the delusion that the cash prize will offset all the social and economic problems inherent in their society.**\n\n>Neoliberalism is a policy model that encompasses both politics and economics and seeks to transfer the control of economic factors from the public sector to the private sector. Many neoliberalism policies enhance the workings of free market capitalism and attempt to place limits on government spending, government regulation, and public ownership.  \n>  \n>Neoliberalism is often associated with the leadership of Margaret Thatcher\u2013the prime minister of the U.K. from 1979 to 1990 and leader of the Conservative Party from 1975 to 1990\u2013and Ronald Reagan, the 40th president of the U.S. (from 1981 to 1989). More recently, neoliberalism has been associated with policies of austerity and attempts to cut government spending on social programs.  \n>  \n>The policies of neoliberalism typically supports fiscal austerity, deregulation, free trade, privatization, and a reduction in government spending.  \n>  \n>Neoliberalism is often associated with the economic policies of Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom and Ronald Reagan in the United States.  \n>  \n>There are many criticisms of neoliberalism, including its tendency to endanger democracy, workers\u2019 rights, and sovereign nations\u2019 right to self-determination.\n\nThe protagonist in the tale, Gi-hun Seong (Korean: \uc131\uae30\ud6c8) represents South Korea's economic rise from a poor farming village in the 1950s to one of the most economically powerful nations in the world today and whose $1.6 trillion GDP is ranked 10th in the world.\n\nUtilising the blueprint of American reality TV shows such as Survivor, Squid Game players are secretly transferred to an island and stripped of all their clothes and belongings while unconscious, then placed in rooms where they must pass one test after another, lured by the delusional belief that wealth will solve all their problems.\n\nAlso inherent is the divisive psychology of the South Korean educational system in which students are pitted against one other in a ranking system in which only the top test taking students are allowed to enter university or attain middle class jobs.\n\nAmericans are portrayed as cruel tormentors whose elite VIPs are obese, scotch drinking, gluttonous men whose open lust for sex with youthful East Asian servant boys are compounded by their perverse sort of entertainment which determines who wins the cash prize while those who use this system to profit illegally from the sidelines are executed.\n\nThe disgraced doctor and members of the masked Squid Game soldiers who are secretly profiting from the selling of human organs and who are executed and hung in front of the game players symbolically represent the politics of how Middle Eastern nations such as Iraq and Libya profited from alliance with the Americans but their bypassing of the Central Banking system became a catalyst for war. The public executions of Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi sent shockwaves around the world and the designers of the Squid Game are not afraid to shoot their own in order to promote their message of \"equality\".\n\nThe \"old man\" represents the Central Banking System and the IMF, who lends money to nations, putting them in lifelong debt. They are the masterminds of the Squid Game. As long as people value money above all else, they will always be in power.\n\nAs with the tenets of neoliberal capitalism, the Central Banking System that rules the world today inherently supplants a methodology that one must amass vast amounts of wealth in order to escape the horrors of everyday life. People are lured to become billionaires at any cost in order to attain social privilege and elite status. The bonds that make us human are deemed as the \"losers\". The Squid Game players are everyday people whose inability to see beyond the mirage of money choose to forgo their humanity in order to play a set of games in which the rules are ultimately designed for them to lose."

We learn that this is just the Korean version of this thing, so there are probably many levels above Il-nam. !<\n\n>!\\- Gi-Hun walks back off the plane corridor like a man on a mission.!<\n\nI mean, I thought the ending was itself a clear indication that a Season 2 was always intended, then I find out that wasn't originally the case at all. I mean, I guess every first season ends with a \"wait and see\" based on how much money it makes, but it sure sets up nicely for a Season 2. Certainly not one of those shows where everything is all tidied up at the end. \n\nThoughts?"

Even then, though, the campiness only partially works. You'd want them over the top, but probably to also for some of them at least to find the human dramas unfolding in front of them to be interesting, like a play. Hunger Games was by no means great literature, but I think they did the callous elite buffoonery thing a lot better. And probably less wooden Western actors, sorry to those men."

With the revelation that the old man uses deception mixed with a hint of truth, it is difficult to know for certain which of these clues are legitimate and which are not.\n\nThe day of the marbles round, it is highly possible that Il-nam was intentionally trying to look weak in order to not have a partner for marbles, which would have resulted in him sitting out the next game and potentially even giving him an easy route out of the games without anyone suspecting anything. This seems especially likely, considering that the next game, the glass bridge, would be impossible to fake a death. However, Gi-hun's kind-heart in picking Il-nam as a partner, meant that they had to improvise and fake his death after the marbles game.\u00a0Mi-nyeo being given a free pass to the next round may have been improvised as well.\n\n\nHere we go the last one was taken down and that's 100% my fault for not mentioning spoiler"

        "text": "So the short version is; I'd give it a 6-7\/10. Pretty good show but does have \\*some\\* problems that I'd like to address below. Though I'd say it's worth a watch if you like \\*really\\* violent metaphores for the ruthless capitalist system that we are all subject to. **Please stop here if you want to avoid spoilers.**\n\n**Last Chance.**\n\nNow for the longer version.\n\nI believe that the show did really well up until Episode 6 or so. I wanted to know how this was gonna end and I kept having that feeling...but then Episode 7 rolls around and things start to change rapidly in a direction that I don't...think is earned or very well developed.\n\n# What seems to be the consensus\n\nI've seen many people on various threads online now who've said that they had problems with the way that the ending was dealt with in Squid Games and honestly I mostly agree, though not for the reasons most often listed. In my opinion there are some things that I feel like some of the criticism aimed at the show are missing about human nature. The reasons I've seen often fall into some of these groups:\n\n* Seong Gi-hun is actually a villain. He caused the most damage by going on instead of trying to end the game and let the money go to the families of the deseased.\n* Cho Sang-Woo should have won! He played the game by the rules! He wouldn't have won by plot convenience like Gi-hun does.\n* Seong Gi-hun was a bastard for moping around for a year before picking up the brother of Kang Sae-byeok after he won the game.\n* Other variations of the above point boils down to \"Why did he not use the money to do better??\"\n* Seong Gi-hun has a bad arc, he didn't become a different person! He should have changed!\n\nThis is by no means an exhaustive list but just some of the points I've most often seen that I feel might not really get to the root of the problem with Squid Games and the way they handeled the climax and ending.\n\n# The Setup\n\nSo from the get-go we learn that Gi-hun is an unlikable person. He whines a lot, he lives with his mother and mooches money off of like an ungrateful leech, forgets about his daugthers birthday and when she won't give him the money he wants, he steals her credit card and tries to steal it from her...except he doesn't even remember his mom's birthday at first. Then he spends the money on gambling and gets beaten up by debt collectors, losing it all again. He is, by most all accounts, a loser. A pathetic loser.\n\nBut what he lacks in likablity (we learn that he actually is pretty decent when he wants to be) he makes up for in relatability. It's easy to relate to his sad situation for most people who watches.\n\nWhen he gets introduced to the games he meets his old childhood friend who was the destined star to be at the university he helped him get into. Except...if he is in this game, then things can't be that good right? We learn through all this that Gi-hun is not very smart, is very morally grey and seemingly cares more about strangers than his own blood.\n\nThe first game rolls around and we really understand the stakes finally. Sounds great. We see something that I must say was really fucking heavy. Watching all those people die like that was...actually a little bit stomach twisting. It was so brutal and sudden. I'm sure the writers intended for this feel. Gi-hun's friend helps him out by telling him what to do, and we also meet Ali the strongest man alive (seemingly anyway) with a naive heart of gold. We also learn about Sae-byeok and how she is a very emotionally shut off person. Finally we have old man Oh Il-nam who has a tumor in his head and is suffering from worsening dimentia. So that's the crew we learn to care about, mostly, compared to the rest of the cast.\n\nAs the series goes on people die left and right and we start to get the final crew nailed down to the people mentioned above. The rest of the stuff doesn't matter much. Yes, the police storyline literally leads nowhere considering how much time they spent on that it's infuriating but it doesn't really change anything about the main character's fates so is rather...weird as a b-plot.\n\n# Cho Sang-Woo: Not Enough Foreshadowing\n\nSo here is the first problem; Cho Sang-Woo's transformation from a calculating and kind of shady man to a cold blooded murderer who will make people expendable explicitly. From the get-go we learn that he withholds information about the cookie game from the group and picks the easiest shape because of it to win the challenge. He is looking out for himself by calculating his highest chance of success. Nothing wrong with risk assessment right? His behaviour here is fairly consristent and only gets a bit shadier as time goes on. Not by a lot though.\n\nBut he doesn't actually become a killer until the Marbles game when Ali is beating him because he doesn't play as Sang-woo expects. Up until this point they have bonded multiple times and created a relationship that should be more emotional than it ends up being. As Sang-Woo is about to lose and die, he grabs Ali by the collar and accuses him of cheating. Of course Ali does not understand and just played the game as he was taught by Sang-Woo. Then something odd happens; Sang-woo *somehow* convinces Ali that they can both live...if they somehow get the marbles from other...groups..? I don't understand how Sang-woo talked his way out of Ali beating him but whatever it was, it took me out of the show completely. Ali should not have died that game and Sang-woo did him so dirty in a way that doesn't make sense to me. But okay, he steals the marbles (which technically goes against the rules of \"play to win them\" but whatever, technicality) and then the observer who was there the whole time says \"Yep, looks good\". Ali is killed and Sang-woo lives on, Ali realising at the last moment what had actually happened.\n\nThis feels rushed. This feels like a *complete* change of character with too little foreshadowing. He just became a cold blooded killer, just like that.\n\nThe few games that are left he continues the behaviour. In the bridge game he kills the glass maker because he was taking a few seconds too long to decide, justifying the kill to Gi-hun by saying he was gonna be waiting like Deuk-so and kill them all, with no proof that this would be the case. Now he is suddenly all like \"What's another kill?\".\n\nAfter the bridge explodes and Sae-byeok almost gets killed by a piece of glass hitting her abdomen Gi-hun for the first time since the show started considers killing Sang-woo because of how despicable of a person he believes Sang-woo has become. Just in that moment of anger as he sees Sae-byeok dying on the bed. She stops him.\n\nThen when he tries to get help, Sang-woo gets up and finishes off Sae-byeok putting Gi-hun over the edge. He has tried to be positive this whole time and tried to do the right thing that he could, the best he could. And now he is done. Gi-hun's change here makes sense as his spirit was broken in that moment. But Sang-woo is not however. This was not foreshadowed nearly enough to get him to this point.\n\nThen of course, at the end, he gets to kill himself and somehow it's played off as a \"redemption\" arc as he dies out and lets Gi-hun win. I don't buy it. It's rushed in the last three episodes and not nearly developed enough to feel earned. It would have made much more sense to let Sae-byeok be the last player and they both kill off Sang-woo together. This way the emotional gut punch would have been so much stronger after the promise they made to each other. At least in my opinion.\n\n# Kang Sae-byeok: Too little development\n\nFor how much we focus on Sae-byeok's life both when she returns from the game the first time to the real world and then again in the Marbles game with Ji-yeong, it feels like she was supposed to be more siginificant but just was never given the time and attention to get there and so when the climax came up with Sang-woo the writers needed her dead so that she wasn't part of the final stand-off. I cannot otherwise figure out why she seemingly was part of the impotant trio, yet given the axe treatment once we got to the last part. We knew more about her than we did Sang-woo at the final point of the show. Sang-woo was not special, he was just running fromt debt like most others.\n\nSae-byeok was a North Korean refugee who fled to South Korea with her brother and her dad was caught by Chinese police and sent back to North Korea. Her mom is still supposedly alive but we don't know about her father. We know she wants to spend the prize money to take her brother and mother to a place that is nothing like Korea at all and just live her life there like she promised her brother.\n\nWhat do we know about Sang-woo? He is a failed student that was destined for greatness from a South Korean slum. He owes billions and he lied to his mother about being a successful businessman on business travel.\n\nThat's about it. Why do we get to know so much about her, care about her and want to see her make it, yet she just gets killed off while Sang-woo gets to live for the final showdown, a character that is more like a side-kick than a main cast character? It feels switched around for no real reason other than writers not remembering to do their story threads justice.\n\n# The Ending\n\nThe ending was just that some ridiculously rich old guys, led by Oh Il-nam (I assume since he was the host), were getting bored because they had more money than they could ever spend, so they made up this sadistic game to feel something again. That to me is bullshit. This is like \"the whole thing was a dream\" ending. Yes, you certainly subverted my expectations, but No, you did not do it in a smart or good way that left me thinking. It just left me upset and disappointed. I think the writers thought this was gonne be more thought provoking than it actually was.\n\nOh Il-nam being the real villain behind the whole operation just felt so...wrong. Like when he \"died\" in the Marbles game I thought that was hard enough to watch and it pulled my heartstrings to have the old guy be demented and then turns out he was fucking with Gi-hun the whole time. Now that we know he was never gonna die from this game we can only assume that Il-nam was just a sadistic fuck that was way more psychopathic than originally expected. Not just a cold capitalist, but a fully fledged psychopath. If he had not been the host and just died that game...I'd have been much better with that.\n\nJust because something subverts expectations does not mean it's good or deep inherently. It has to be *good* subversion also.\n\nAlso, the fact that Oh Il-nam is like \"I didn't force anyone to play so...\" is just so weak. It doesn't say anything about the human condition it's just a cheap shot to make it seem like humans are just greedy and untrustworthy when presented with a taste of power. The fact that it's just a technicality\n\nIf I was to guess, whoever wrote this show didn't have a good ending to this show and decided to go with what we got instead to try and make a point about money and power; that it's evil....okay hurray? It wasn't really done well was it? It was just so on the nose and heavy handed. As subtle as a brick to the face. #deep am I right?\n\nAnd why was the Captain that police guys brother anyway? What did that add to the story? Nothing is what that added. Just a weird twist that even if you saw it coming (I did guess he was the Captain or one of the VIPs) it didn't actually change, remove or add anything.\n\n# Counterpoints\n\nSo I listed a bunch of opinions further up that I'd like to inspect and counter a little bit.\n\n* Some people believe that Gi-hun was really a villain because instead of trying to end the games he instead perpetuated them with everyone else. The worst possible outcome happened; He lost everything and gained billions for it instead of letting that money go to the dead people's families.\n\nI don't think this is quite accurate and it misses a key point about Gi-hun as a person: He has a crippling gambling addiction. It's not something you just get rid of by the drop of a hat. It would take work to get that out of your system and he is still suffering from it throughout the series like when he can't pick a number for the bridge game. He is not in a mental position to just give up and go home. He is not even thinking about those families. Actually *all* of the participants pretty much forget about that point almost immediately and it's never really brought up again. Gi-hun is not unique in this aspect and he is consistent with his character flaws.\n\n* Cho Sang-Woo should have won. He was doing the right thing by playing the game by the rules and not to be emotional or just lucky like Gi-hun.\n\nThing is, he was only starting to really play by the rules when he killed Ali. Up until that point he justified it away that others were doing the killing, certainly not himself. He shielded himself from responsibility because he is a coward. This is shown in the way he can't even go see his own mother earlier in the show. He didn't deserve to win because (as mentioned earlier) his whole villain phase was rushed and unearned.\n\n* Why didn't Gi-hun go and get the brother from the orphanage until a year had passed? What an asshole to not just get going and do it.\n\nHe was a broken man at this point. Everyone he cared about in the game were dead. His previous best friend has shattered his worldview and killed himself right in front of him. Couldn't even save his own mother. He has all the money in the world now, but he has never been in this situation and cannot fathom what has happened. He needs time to process. He was in no position to take care of a himself, much less a child.\n\n* Why did Gi-hun not do good with the money he won?\n\nWell because he was a broken man who had never had that sort of power or money before. I don't think most people could really fathom what to do with billions. It's so unfathomable in terms of riches.\n\n* Gi-hun didn't actually have a character arc. He is pretty much the same person as he was at the end. That seems wrong.\n\nTo this point I think people are missing a fundamental thing about Gi-hun throughout the show: At no point does he change dramatically because that is not how humans work and this story is trying to tell a story with people that are (mostly) three dimensional. He needed to process and even then the traumatic event he experienced changed him into a bitter, apathetic and lost man, but didn't change him for the better because his flaws were too ingrained in him. His character arc consisted of beating into him that his optimistic approach to the most dire situations (what kept him alive, basically) will not be enough to actually live in a cold, capitalist world.\n\nI think that was more or less it. I still mostly enjoyed the show, but I can't go higher than 7\/10 in terms of my evaluation because of the above."

Even if the concept of the Squid Games are still constant between the two seasons, it will otherwise be a completely different season with completely different characters.          \n\nPersonally, I think the best way for it to go regarding the second season is to focus on the next Squid Games a year after the one in the first season, with completely different characters, and with Gi-Hun taking the role of Jun-Ho trying to to infiltrate\/stop the games.         \n\nOr, another direction the second season could go is to focus on the next Squid Games, but have it be in the perspective of one of the pink soldiers. We could finally figure out where these people come from, why they are so young, and what caused them to get into that situation.    \n\nWhat do you guys think?"

        "text": "Squid Game reminded me of one of my favorite books, \"They Shoot Horses, Don't They?\" Anyone else? I'm wondering if any fans fluent in Korean culture and current events can shed some light on this comparison.\n\n\"They shoot horses don't they\" is an incredible book from the US, set in the marathon dance competitions of the 1930s during the Great Depression. It was remade into a mediocre movie starring the great Jane Fonda. The title refers to how horses are shot to be put out of their misery. The story is great, fast, and very critical. The characters are metaphors for things about the US- for example a societal trend, an obsolete cultural attitude, dynamics between backgrounds...\n\nDoes SG have similar parallels? Do certain characters represent something larger than their story line that may not be obvious to someone outside the culture?\n\nI was hoping SG was based on a book because I would have loved to spend more time with those characters and learn more about them, and maybe understand more about the answer to my question. The obvious statement about ultra rich vs everyone else is easy to see. But it doesn't seem like a coincidence for example, that both refugee\/migrant characters are killed by Sang-woo, or that the scenes with the VIPs are the only part in English.\n\nThanks for any insight! Apologies if there is already a thread on this. I browsed but couldn't find one.\n\nAnd readers, please check out this book. Find the copy with the analysis and screenplay at the end. It's short but has really stuck with me!\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/2m7bgl3uug681.png?width=531&format=png&auto=webp&s=58a70316454c89618d86d9a68156c43e2ec06e3c"

We now know he wasn\u2019t the most ethical player, and I could see his strategy not letting an old man or young girl survive, as he didn\u2019t want to team up with them to begin with.  But even if he was disloyal to his friend, why not let Gi-Hun and Ali know, as he perceived them to be strong players he could use to further his game?\n\n2. Was Player 1 (the old man) really in danger at any point?  In the Dalgano game, he acted as clueless as the rest and chose the star instead of triangle.  If he didn\u2019t finish in time, would they have snuck him off to fake-kill him?  I assume the guards, at least the square-faces, were in on his true identity. \n\n3. Why did they kill the guard who took off his mask, when the only player to witness it just killed himself?  Was it just out of principle, to make an example out of him to others?\n\n4. The Front Man made a big stink about equality within the game being sacred, yet Player 1 not only joined in his own game, he changed the outcome by sharing tips on tug-o-war that helped his team pull out an underdog win.  So where did the idea of equality and \u201cfairness\u201d come from?  Is The Front Man allowed to contribute his own ideas on how the game should be played?  I have to believe someone must\u2019ve tried to cheat in his year\u2026\n\n5. There were years between The Front Man going missing and him reappearing within the game.  Did he never spend any of his winnings?  I mean, his brother was a detective, so there was no trail?  And if he had all that money, what could entice or coerce him into becoming an insider to the games that tried to kill him?\n\nSorry if people have brought these up before, I\u2019m just catching up with this sub\u2026 Thank you for your thoughts."

Suffice to say these portrayals seldomly helped against exotism and dehumanising stereotypes. I had the misfortune of reading some comments below a Rush Hour clip on YouTube. Strongly advice any decent person to not venture into this :S. - So many people being nostalgic and seemingly provoked by the fact that society moves forward; \"Today's snowflakes and cancel culture can't handle this type of film\", etc. \n\nI think it is very ethnocentric to feel sad about Asian people's problem with being portrayed as something narrow such as a comical figure with a strong accent, a nerd or an exotic sexualised woman. I also find it thought provoking that a lot of people who are upset with racism being brought up, have never experienced racism or their ethnic heritage being the constant focus. \n\nWith the success of Parasite, Squid Game and other East Asian films and series, people elsewhere can finally see Asians on screen that are NOT seen from an outside perspective, influenced by both subtle racism and exotism. It's more on the Asians' own terms, and the characters are humanised through their actions and narratives rather than the heavy focus on ethnicity. I think that is great!"

I do not want to see him gradually be absorbed into this world and eventually either become as bad as them, or be forced to make immoral and evil decisions that makes him morally ambiguous. Whether you consider him an anti-hero or a hero right now, he has a wonderful innocence   about him even at the end, proven by his refusal to directly take a life. So after the games when he returns home he's a lot more similar to a traumatized soldier coming home from the war than a man who selfishly did anything to survive. His survival was warlike, as it was up to chance most of the time. Throughout the season, he was no more mean than any normal person who has major burdens to bear and a lot of stress.\n\nI worry about him going back, with his hair dyed red which frankly just reminds me of Satan or the Anti-Christ or whatever version of the devil you can imagine. I don't want the future of his character written as an exploration of turning good to evil. I'd rather see things go the other way around, for evil characters. Redemption is a much more powerful message in our dark times than average typical falls from grace."

He advised gi-hun in the first game that he can stand behind someone so that the doll cannot spot him moving. 2. He killed himself in the last game for gi-hun to take the money away. 3. That he pushed the person down during the glass bridge game to save sae byeok and gi-hun so that 3 of them could survive as he noticed that there was no more time and him , sae-byeok and gi hun might have died already when he did not push the man down. 4. He gave his breakfast to ali. 5. He cares for his mother and she is the reason why he joined the squid game to get money. I know this is an unpopular opinion though. But idk whats ur opinion so yea."

This shows he's a complete hypocrite and is has no moral high ground over Sang-Woo.\n\nHe vehemently questions the Front Man and 001\/Il-Nam's morals about creating the games after all the participants willingly returned *after* experiencing the first game, which means they willingly chose dying to the games, and killing each other over dying\/living in penury\/jail on their own.\n\nWhat do you guys think?"

It is such a shame, as most of these posts are indeed high quality and high effort, and pose reasonable discussion for other users. However, we do have a strict NO SPOILER policy, in r\/squidgame . This is a friendly reminder to ensure that the title of all your submissions, whether it be an image, question, theory, or even meme, don't disclose any type of spoiler about the show. Also please don't forget to mark posts that contain spoilers within, are clearly marked 'SPOILER'. To those questioning why we are so strict about this rule, it is because there are always users browsing this sub who have NOT seen the show yet, and are just checking to see what it's about. If there are any questions, please ask in the comments down below, or contact us on modmail. \n\nThanks for now, \n\nThe Mod Team :)"

Player one selects a bib # such that he is last, or among the very last to cross. In this scenario he would then proceed to the final squid game with the steak knives and this is unpredictable, uncontrollable and he would be easy to overpower.\n\nChoice #2.  Player one selects an bib # such that he is among the first to cross, but of course he isn't going to play the game straight up, so he knows which windows to step upon.  If he is bib number 2, 3, or 4, players with bibs 5 through 16 all cross safely and the squid game knife fight will be quite ruthless as everyone behind him crosses safely. \n\nIn short, player one can't play the windows game without destabilizing the process and ruining the end result so marbles is where he must stop.\n\nI bring this point up because I believe it speaks to player 001's motives.  He didn't just lose to #456 because he wasn't there mentally, or out of graciousness, he in effect had to quite at that stage. \n\nFinally, this also means he was not really playing the game, or was playing even less, which is what he sought in the first place.\n\nRasputin"

        "text": " \n\nSo, for those of you who don\\`t know there is a trope created by TV Tropes called Complete Monster (also known as Pure Evil). They are regarded as the very worst of the worst characters from a certain franchise. There are a lot of requirements for these trope but the main ones are the following:\n\n1. The character has ABSOLUTELY NO REDEEMING QUALITIES. Even if a character has some redeeming qualities at the start of the story he\/she could still become a Complete Monster if he\/she loses them. Even one single redeeming quality is enough to disqualify a character from this trope.\n2. The character in question commits horrible, atrocious crimes that are presented seriously within the story and their actions are worse than the actions of most other villains in the story. We also take into account their resources and their ability to cause harm to other people. This means that if a character has more resources (if for example he\/she is a ruler that commands thousands of people), then he\/she needs to comit bigger atrocities in order to stand out. If a character has less resources to harm people (for example, if he\/she is a lone serial killer), then he\/she qualifies if their crimes are heinous enough considering their resources. If a character\\`s actions are not heinous enough by the standards of the story then he\/she can\\`t be a Complete Monster. The character\\`s crimes must pass several different heinous standards in order for the character to count as a Complete Monster:\n\n\\- The baseline standard - This is a common standard that all villains need to pass, no matter the work they come from. This means that the villain needs to commit crimes that are worse than animal cruelty, theft, abuse (unless the abuse is REALLY extreme but that rarely happens) and trying to kill the main characters (because this is something most villains try to do).\n\n\\- The standards of the work - This means that the villain should be compared to other villains from the same work (or franchise) to see if his\/her actions are bad enough to make him\/her stand out. This means that a villain who comes from a lighthearted series like My Little Pony needs to be compared to other villains from My Little Pony and not to villains from grimdark franchises such as Warhammer 40000, A Song of Ice and Fire and Berserk. Similarly, a villain who comes from a work with\u00a0high heinous standard should\u00a0 be compared to other villains from the same franchise and not to\u00a0villains that come from My Little Pony.\n\n\\- The resource standard - This means that we should also take into consideration the villain\\`s resources and their ability to hurt other people as I already mentioned.\n\n\\- The system standard - This means that if a villain is part of an organization or a group, then the villain needs to be the worst member or one of the worst (if the organisation is big like the Galactic Empire for example)\n\n3) The character\\`s motivation for commiting those crimes or the character him\/herself are never portrayed sympathetically and he\/she has either no excuse for his\/her actions or their excuse is not portrayed sympathetically. Even if the character in question has some traumatic moment that has shaped his\/her personality, it doesn\\`t excuse their actions and the narrative doesn\\`t try to make you feel sorry for them. In short, this means that the audience is not supposed to feel ANY SYMPATHY for the character.\n\n4) The character has enough understanding of human morality to tell right from wrong and make decisions. This means that characters who are severely mentally ill, possessed or brainwashed, made of evil or from a race or culture that can\\`t comprehend morality or has an entirely different morality can\\`t qualify. However, characters who are mentally ill can still qualify if they can tell right from wrong despite their mental illness (for example, the Joker).\n\n5) The character is portrayed seriously and is not a Comic Relief (a character you are supposed to laugh at and not take very seriously). Even if the character is funny he\/she can still be a Complete Monster if they are portrayed seriously despite their sense of humor. If the character is treated as a joke by the narrative itself (which often happens in kid\\`s shows), then he\/she can\\`t be a Complete Monster.\n\n6) The character must make AT LEAST ONE APPEARANCE in the story itself. Characters that are just mentioned by other characters and make no appearance\u00a0can\\`t qualify. Aside from that, if all the crimes commited by the character happen off-screen\/off-page\u00a0and are only vaguely described, then he\/she can\\`t be a Complete Monster.\n\n7) The audience is not supposed to feel bad for a Complete Monsterr when something bad happens to him\/her because their comeuppance is completely deserved and the narrative doesn\\`t try to make the audience feel sympathy for the Complete Monster.\n\n8) The character must come from a work which has at least some semblence of plot and is not pure exploitation and is more complex than \"bad guy does evil things for no apparent reason\" type of plot. A horror film or book can still contain a Complete Monster but it needs to have some plot. For this reasons films like Human Centipede and Serbian Film don\\`t contain Complete Monsters because they are viewed by TvTropes as plotless exploitation\u00a0even though the villains are extremely repulsive.\n\n9) A character must meet ALL of the above mentioned criteria in order to be a Complete Monster.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJang Deok-su is listed as a Complete Monster and here is his entry:\n\n [Jang Deok-su](https:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/DirtyCoward) is [the worst](https:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/TheBully) amongst all of the contestants in the [brutal games](https:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/DeadlyGame). A former gangster out to get the money for himself, Deok-su has participated in murder, forced prostitution, and rape with his thugs. In the special game, Deok-su initiates a [riot](https:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/PrisonRiot) to cull as many players as possible; beats a man to death for objecting to Deok-su taking his food; and betrays his ally Han Mi-nyeo while believing it will mean her death. Relishing in slaughtering another team in the Tug-Of-War game, Deok-su repeatedly enjoys the deaths of other players if it means getting himself ahead of the games, and upon the glass bridge game, he attempts to force other players to risk almost certain death or to die when he refuses to advance himself. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n So, do you agree with him being listed as a Complete Monster or do you think he is not bad enough compared to those who make the games?\n\n Also, before you ask, Il-nam himself doesn't count for this trope because his friendship with the main character is genuine (he buys food for him, enjoys spending time with him, lets him win the game of marbles and summons him when he is about to die), has some moral standards as he stops the fight when it threatens to get out of control and also votes to let everyone go home during the vote and allows them the choice to decide if they want to come back, genuinely loves his wife and sons considering the way he speaks about them, is nice to other people in general and there is no indication that it's a facade and his death is played for sympathy by the story as he laments there is no goodness in the world.\n\n The Front Man also doesn't count because he has some sense of honor and tries to ensure that the games are fair and nobody is cheating and also shows some regret for killing his brother (after the murder, he hallucinates that his brother is staring back at him from the mirror and asks him why he killed him and the Front man starts crying).\n\n The VIPS also don't qualify for this trope because they are a group of people and they don't do anything to stand out enough. The old, pervert who tried to rape the detective doesn't count either because one rape is not enough to make him stand out."

Gi-hun bet \"anything\/everything he had.\" Had he lost, it would have been a spiritual sort of death, an internal death, and it would have been a worse price to pay than physical death.

        "text": "\nThe only thing that has stuck vividly in my mind is that Squid Game has a bit of inspiration from a show from 1967-1968 called The Prisoner.\n\n\n\n\nIt was helmed by Patrick McGoohan, an actor who was offered a role as James Bond for Dr. No (1962) but turned it down. The brief premise is that a highly trained operative resigns from his espionage days, and attempts to go on vacation. He is gassed in his flat and mysteriously ends up in a Village (Portmeirion in Wales), where his overlords have a network of cameras, radar, and other observation tools. And no one can escape, lest die trying. \n\n\n\nOnly 17 Episodes that\u2019s available through YouTube or Archive.org\n\n\n**Spoilers for The Prisoner down below. If you don\u2019t care, then catch the wave**\n\n\n\nAnyways, there are numerous elements that both shows share:\n\n\n\n\n1. Targeted Demographics: In The Prisoner, the targets were people who were military, government, or revolutionary based. All of them that would stir trouble for one or all governments in general. In Squid Game, the chosen population were debtors, gamblers, and people who were in squalor seeking to repay their loans\/debt for a huge cash prize. \n\n\n\n\n2. Isolated Location: Both series take place on an isolated area. In The Prisoner, it\u2019s unclear (at the start of the series) where this Village is located. It was speculated throughout episodes to be in Eastern Europe (\u201c30 miles from the Polish border\u201d) or Southwest of Iberia (\u201cIt might be an island\u201d). In actuality, it was within the vicinity of London. In Squid Game, it takes place on an island (don\u2019t think it was stated in series, but correct me if I\u2019m wrong)\n\n\n\n\n3. No Escapes: Both shows have the explicit rule of not leaving. If you leave, you die. In The Prisoner, the major obstacle is a spherical device called Rover (a giant white weather balloon). It has the capacity to incapacitate you or to kill you on the spot. For Squid Game, the Triangle Pink Soldiers (the fellers with the machine guns) will shoot you. \n\n\n\n4. Numbers: The Prisoner features numbers predominantly like Squid Game. Number 1 isn\u2019t revealed until the end, but everyone else is inferior to Number 2 (who is rotated from time to time). The main character is Number 6, yet resents being referred as a number. It\u2019s self explanatory for Squid Game. \n\n\n\n5. Masks: In the Final episode of The Prisoner, there is a conference of various people who wear the Sock and Buskin mask (the comedy and tragedy mask symbol) and represent facets of humanity, in science, social status, ideology, and so forth. Number 1 also wears a mask (2 rather). The Front Man, VIPs and the Pink Soldiers wear masks. \n\n\n\n6. Quotes: There are two instances where I can listen to the dialogue and it instantly reminds me of The Prisoner. Specifically\u2026\n\n\n\u201cThis is the Front Man speaking.\u201d\n\n\u201cNumber 2 here.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI am not a horse. I\u2019m a person.\u201d \n\n\u201cI am not a number. I\u2019m a person.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n7. Music: Music plays (literally) an excellent role in both series. Both of them share classical music for cues and mood. The Prisoner utilizes Jazz and electronic music. And Squid Game incorporates traditional Korean music (which is very amazing) and modern electronic moments. \n\n\n\n\nLet me know what you think (especially for those who\u2019ve seen The Prisoner as well) as well as other elements the shows share."

Even in 1988, Gi-hun could have been a 14-year-old middle school student at the time.  It's possible that before Gi-hun's father got into the game, he also had financial problems in his life like Gi-hun himself in Episode 1. We know that Il-Nam and Gi-hun live in the same neighborhood.  It might just be a coincidence.  If the son of Il-Nam that Il-Nam was referring to was really Gi-hun himself, Gi-hun should have been surprised and remembered the house Il-Nam showed him during the Marble game.  It's possible that Il-Nam's wife might have died and his son might have moved out of town and he doesn't know if his father who is Il-Nam himself made this dangerous game.  Back to information about Gi-hun's father, Gi-hun himself and his mother might not know if he died because of being eliminated in the game.  They could have the same fate as SangWoo's mother.  Even SangWoo's mother didn't know that her son who was SangWoo himself died at the end of the game.  If he had known, he would have prepared an offering for his dead son.  Even SangWoo's mother still thought that SangWoo himself was still hiding from the cops who wanted to chase him."

        "text": "Something about the old man\u2019s plot arc doesn\u2019t hang together for me.  Essentially, I don\u2019t really understand how his plan to play the game worked if it allowed him to return to his luxury suite when he lost.\n\nIf he was really playing the game, he should have died when he lost the marble game.  If he knew he was just going to be pretend shot, he didn\u2019t have anything at stake and thus wasn\u2019t fully experiencing the game, was he?  And it makes me question whether he was being protected in all the games he played.  This seems incompatible with his desire to really participate in the games.\n\nThe best I can come up with is that he was really playing up until the VIPs arrived, and always planed to make an exit if he made it that far.  The marble game seems like a tribute to his childhood, so maybe it was designed as his coup de gr\u00e2ce before sneaking out and returning to the VIP world.\n\nBut this explanation isn\u2019t really satisfying to me, because even if this was his plan, the stakes of the game were always lower for him than for the others, which seems incompatible with his desire to really experience the thrill of the game.  That\u2019s why he said there was no point watching with the VIPs\u2014it couldn\u2019t compare to being in the games.  But it seems like he chose to take himself out.\n\nI thought it made for an interesting reveal in the last episode, but it seems like it was conceived just for the plot-twist value.  But when the twist doesn\u2019t stand up to scrutiny, it\u2019s not satisfying as a twist.  Am I being overly picky?  Does anyone have a different way of understanding this arc?"

        "text": "SPOILERS AHEAD FOR THE ENTIRE SEASON 1 !!!\n\nBefore I begin:\n\n1. Yes, I know the games' fundamental rules (clauses 1-3 and everything the pink guard with square mask says in episode 1) never state there could only be a single winner.\n2. Yes, if Sae-Byeok hadn't been injured by that glass fragment and hadn't been killed by Sang-Woo, she would have teamed up with Gi-Hun for the final round and most likely won it together.\n\nBut have you ever wondered why we never get a reference to a past game where two or more players won, or why during Season 1, the gamemakers took decisions that lead to the deaths of more players than there should have been otherwise, or why the games are even designed the way they are in the first place?\n\nHere's the theory in a nutshell: The games are meant to have a sole winner.\n\nI'll start with the ***Archives Scene***, where police officer Jun-Ho examines the list of past games and their winners. Given that Squid Game has been a thing since 1988, there have been at least 32 past games, so, statistically, it's quite likely for us to see a case with at least two victors. And yet, we don't. Even from the earliest ones. But fine, let's dismiss this as a coincidence.\n\nNow, let's look at everything else I could gather as evidence from Season 1's games (including what happened in-between them) in favor of this theory:\n\n**Red Light, Green Light:** The fact that nobody knew what the guards meant exactly by elimination, combined with the no-info-beforehand rule, lead to the panicking of more than 1\/3 of all players after 324 and 250 had gotten shot. Moreover, players had to cross the finish line without getting caught in 5:00, otherwise they'll get shot like everyone in Episode 1 who ran out of time.\n\n**The Voting and the Rejoining:** After the remainder of players (201) voted to end the games, 187 willingly (well, given their miserable lives it wasn't that much of a free choice) returned, leaving 14 people who didn't. What's their fate is up to debate, but given the Frontman's comment about taking care of them, I reckon they were murdered. This also explains why Gi-Hun wins the full prize money (45.6 billion won, 1 million won per death), because in order to happen so, all the other players need to be eliminated. That's impossible if the aforementioned 14 people are still alive, therefore they technically wouldn't have lost the games.\n\n**Honeycomb:** Not only did the 4 different shapes have a varying difficulty, but notice how despite the playground being \"adult-sized\", the room still ended up being crammed, with all the players close to each other. Thus, when 369 got shot for breaking his umbrella (although he was sitting up on the slide), a chain reaction was unleashed and more people got eliminated. And once again, timer.\n\n**The riot between games 2 and 3:** Surprisingly enough, Honeycomb was the least deadly game of all percentagewise, with only around 42% of the players getting killed. Just for the sake of comparison, the second and third place are taken by Tug of War and Squid Game, which have exactly 50% death rate. Ironically, the riot of Deok-Su (101) and his gang was initiated the night between games 2 and 3. Why? Tug of War was going to be played in teams of 10, meaning that from 108 people remaining, there will be 8 left with no full team. If this happened for real, then those 8 players would have probably followed Han Mi-nyeo's (212) fate in Episode 6 of skipping the challenge. And since my theory claims the games are against multiple winners, it makes sense that, as we learn from one of the organ smuggling scenes, the gamemakers purposefully gave everyone less food, resulting in Deok-Su's gang cutting in-line and leaving a few contestants empty-handed. And when Deok-Su killed 271 for trying to retrieve his portion, it becomes obvious how you can kill people in-between rounds and get away with it. Finally, the riot ends when Il-Nam (001, also known as the host) screams in terror and only 80 people have survived.\n\n**Tug of War:** Now with 80 people left to form 8 teams, the next round proceeds as planned. Really the only actual clue here is how the game favors physical strength. Because of this, the majority of contestants who pass the challenge are men. Now, I don't want to talk much about gender stereotypes, but men tend to be more impulsive and aggressive, thus, in the following games, it's more likely for the participants to attack and kill each other in order to progress further (a good example is Glass Stepping Stones, but we'll talk about it later).\n\n**Gganbu:** 40 players remaining. Everything seems to be going as it should, but it turns out, player 111 (the doctor) was caught cheating via helping organ smugglers in exchange for a sneak peak of the next game, therefore elimination. That leaves 39 people still playing. Because 39 is an odd number, only 19 pairs enter, leaving Han Mi-nyeo alone. Some of you may argue that the guards could have just shot her on the spot, but keep in mind that every player is watched closely and the gamemakers most likely know about her complicated relationship with Deok-Su. Therefore, by letting her live, they save some more drama for the VIPs (and indirectly save the games in round 5 from being ruined by Deok-Su). After Gganbu, from all the 38 players who entered, only 16 emerge victorious (17 with 212). That's weird because this round is \"player vs player\" and half the players are guaranteed to die. But if you watched episode 6, you know how the true villain of the series, *the timer,* made a return and since the core rule is to take all of your partner's marbles, the 3 pairs who ran out of time and didn't announce a winner got eliminated.\n\n**Player 069's suicide:** 069 played against his wife (070), which resulted in her execution. Between games 4 and 5, he freaks out due to survivor's guilt and PTSD, begging everyone to do a game-over vote. This ticks off Sang-Woo (218), who then argues with him, reminding how this won't bring his wife (or any dead contestant) back to life. Saddened by this realisation, 069 then kills himself that night. This to me is the prime example of how Gganbu was meant to destroy alliances between players and make them more self-centered, as well as push them further onto the edge.\n\n**Glass Stepping Stones:** Apart from being the only not based on a preexisting children's game round, Glass Stepping Stones also contradicts the gamemakers' \"values\" of equality and fair play. Everyone picks their number of order at random (and basically the first 8 of all 16 players are screwed), the points I made in Tug of War about aggression and Gganbu about drama are proven, *the timer*, how the Frontman turns the lights off when player 017 (the glassmaker) starts guessing the correct glass panels, the explosion of the remaining ones at the end (Sae-Byeok getting injured mortally), you name it.\n\n**The Finalists' Feast:**  With 3 contestants remaining, it's time for the last dinner. This is a similar case as the riot between games 2 and 3, only this time the finalists are given knives after dinner  and it's more tragic.\n\n**Squid game:** Now that (sobs) 067 (sobs) died (bursts into a fountain of tears), only 2 players remain for the final round and I don't have anything new to say.\n\n**The Ultimate Meaning:** Now, after this behemoth of text, let me explain why I believe in this theory, and if it's true, what does it mean for the franchise:\n\n1. The fewer people who know about the games (which apparently are illegal), the better. With only one survivor each year, it will be harder for everyone involved to get exposed. Furthermore, winners will have to explain where all the money they won come from.\n2. *The timer* (THIRST FOR BLOOOD)\n3. This is more of a wild guess, but I think this is meant to represent yet another aspect of any competitive capitalist society: there can only be one on the top. No matter the friendships you make along the way, no matter how much you cheat or try to pass all challenges together, and no matter how close someone is to you, this is the depressing reality.\n\nComments are yours, have a nice day :)"

The different ways that the characters approach the Marble game were all interesting angles that were explored really well. I think the twist of them having to play *against* they\u2019re partners was also very well executed. And the \u2018deaths\u2019 that occur in this episode are all emotional in their own right. I also like how dark this episode gets; one scene that always sticks out to me is the one that happens after Sang-woo accuses Ali of cheating and gets on his hands and knees and cries, telling him that he\u2019s sorry and needs to get home to his mother. This episode, in my opinion, does wonders for Gi-hub\u2019s character, i like how, even though he takes advantage of Il-nam to survive, he is still racked with guilt and from that point onward he acts as a better person. \n\n2) *Front Man*- I like this episode because there isn\u2019t a game or a huge event that all the players have to partake in, and it just gives the characters of the 3 remaining contestants room to breathe, along with Jun-Ho and the reveal involving the Front Man. I also like that this episode wasn\u2019t scared to kill main characters off, and it somehow managed to pull it off without making it feel like it was just for shock-factor. \n \n3) *VIPs*- For the most part, i really like this episode. The only part that puts it below *Front Man* is the handling of the VIPs. I really like the concept of the privileged Americans betting on the impoverished Koreans, but the execution of the idea is, in my opinion, quite poor. However, the Glass Stepping Stones game is my favourite of the 6 games (and it\u2019s not even close), and i love how they ended Mi-Nyeo and Deok-su\u2019s characters. The episode kept me on the edge of my seat at all times, and i loved it.\n\n4) *Stick to the Team*- I really enjoyed this episode. The \u2018special game\u2019 was really fun to watch and then the Tug-of-War game at the end was cool, and i enjoyed the inclusion of a cliff-hanger (literally). This episode was also the introduction of Ji-yeong, who was an amazing character and i loved her dynamic with Sae-byeok. The scene where Gi-hun, Sang-woo, Ali and Sae-byeok team up in the night fight was great to see, and the scene after Deok-su kills the guy and Gi-hun starts shouting at the Front Man through the cameras is probably one of my favourite scenes in the show.\n\n5) *One Lucky Day*- The finale was really good, and it\u2019s only this low down because there were so many other good episodes. The Squid Game fight was really tense, and i genuinely didn\u2019t know which direction the show was going to go. The reveal at the end adds a whole lot to all of the previous episodes in the series, and i personally thought it was an interesting twist but i was really happy with how it played out. The scene that reveals the twist felt very symbolic, although i\u2019m still trying to figure out what it was symbolising, which is the driving force for a rewatch. I also agree with Gi-hun\u2019s decision at the end, and i will defend it *with my life.*\n\n6) *The Man with the Umbrella*- This episode was fun. The Dalgona game was very tense and i was convinced that Il-nam was going to die in this episode, which obviously turned out to be wrong. The scene with Mi-nyeo and Sae-byeok in the bathroom was hilarious, and this served as a proper introduction to the Jun-ho subplot, which was one of my favourite parts of the show.  Overall a solid episode, but i wouldn\u2019t put it above any of the other ones. \n\n7) *Red Light, Green Light*- I think this episode had its ups and downs. The actual Red Light, Green Light scene was chilling, and the *Fly Me to the Moon* sequence was incredible, but i feel like the episode as a whole does a disservice to Gi-hun\u2019s character; he seems like a completely different person to me in this episode when compared to all of the rest. Like for example he steals his mother\u2019s money, and then gambles it all on horses, wins, and then gets pickpocketed (by none other than Sae-byeok). I\u2019m not saying he had to be perfect, but in every other episode he\u2019s (mostly) gentle and caring. Like i can\u2019t see Episode 1 Gi-hun speaking up against Deok-su, or allowing someone to choose the number on the Glass Stepping Stones that he was about to pick. But i didn\u2019t hate the episode by any means, i just couldn\u2019t admire anything about Gi-hun in this one.\n\n8) *A Fair World*- This episode felt the most filler-ey to me, although i still wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s filler. I wasn\u2019t the biggest fan of the Doctor subplot, and that was a very prominent part of this episode. I did like how it furthered Jun-ho\u2019s arc though, and the scenes between Sang-woo and Ali and Gi-hun and Sae-byeok whilst standing guard provided some good character development. I also thought that the scene where Sae-byeok explains to the others that she doesn\u2019t trust any of them was a good way to show that although they were in a \u2018team\u2019, they weren\u2019t a team, and the foreshadowing in that line was very subtle and well thought-out. But my main problem with the episode is that it just feels empty- nothing really happens with the main characters (excluding Jun-ho), and the Doctor kind of takes the spotlight, even though he was a very two-dimensional character. Although I did like to see some more of the workers\u2019 point of view, so that was a plus. \n\n9) *Hell*- This episode was a necessary one to include, but it was boring. For the most part. The scene where all of the remaining players where voting to stop the games was very thought-provoking; my first time watching i felt i would\u2019ve picked to end them, but on a rewatch i felt i would\u2019ve voted to stay. I feel like this episode just takes it\u2019s time and slows things down after the thrill of the first game, although i just found myself wanting it to move on so i could find out what the next one was. Again, it was necessary to find out more about the characters\u2019 lives outside of the game, but it just felt like a very dull episode. Although, the scene involving Gi-hun and Il-nam outside the shop in the rain is so much better upon a second viewing. Definitely the weakest episode, but i wouldn\u2019t say it was *bad*."

A good one I've seen is that while they were required to take their shoes off, there was nothing saying that they couldn't take their shoes with them.  Therefore, if the glass expert revealed himself sooner, he could've told everyone to take their shoes, and then throw them at each panel to listen to the different sounds they made.  If this worked, then most if not all of the remaining contestants could have made it across. \n\n If this method worked, then how do you suppose the last game would've played out with so many contestants remaining?  Additionally, if they still played the squid game with an odd number of people remaining, would they exempt one person from participating and split the prize between all the survivors?"

        "text": "So I know it's gonna be very controversial to post a lot of pro-Ethereum stuff in \/r\/ethereum given all the maxis and ETH killer moonboys who love to spread FUD in every thread. And it's very easy to attack Ethereum when you don't understand what it's trying to be and what it's trying to achieve. So I figured I'd post all the general statements that I and many other have been making over and over for a while now. I'm happy to elaborate on any of them, but please keep the discussion in good faith. I'm also willing to add more points if I forgot some. Some of these are my own opinion, some definitely require more context to understand properly (again, happy to elaborate) but the goal is to quickly summarize all the different stuff that gets brought up over and over.\n\nAnyway yeah, if you're invested in Ethereum, or at the very least interested in it enough to be browsing this sub (why else would you be here lol) then you should be aware of the following:\n\n1. Ethereum is the network, Ether is the currency. And there is no \"I\" anywhere in the name.\n\n2. [Fees are high](https:\/\/cryptofees.info\/) because that's how much the market values Ethereum's limited blockspace. It's purely supply and demand.\n    * Fees scale with [how much computation is being executed](https:\/\/docs.ethhub.io\/using-ethereum\/transactions\/), not how much money is being handled. It costs $5 on average to send any amount of Ether, whether it's $1's worth or $1 million's. It costs much more to do swaps and mint NFTs and such because those operations require more computation.\n    * There is no way for anyone to artificially keep fees high unless they're willing to [literally burn millions of dollars per day for no reason](https:\/\/watchtheburn.com\/).\n\n3. Ethereum's blockspace is limited because letting people run nodes themselves on average consumer hardware is important for decentralization.\n    * Decentralization is a spectrum and has many meanings from protocol specification, protocol implementation, node distribution, coin distribution, censorship resistance, permissionlessness, etc.\n    * Pointing at one aspect to scream \"centralized\" isn't clever nor helpful. Chances are the aspect you point out is known and is an active area of research with a concrete plan on [the roadmap](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/vXMaIyZ.png) to address it and increase decentralization some more.\n    * No blockchain is ever fully decentralized, especially not from the start \u2013 and Ethereum's end goal is to be able to run without a hiccup for *decades* if not *centuries*. At 6.5 years old, it's still very young.\n    * If you care about decentralization, invest in and contribute to projects like Ethereum who view it as a goal, not a crutch that \"nobody cares about it that much anyway, let's just [increase the gas limit](https:\/\/github.com\/binance-chain\/bsc\/issues\/553) to have low fees asap\"\n\n4. There is a [vast difference](https:\/\/ethereum.org\/en\/developers\/docs\/nodes-and-clients\/#node-types) between an \"archive node\" (several TBs) and a \"full node\" (hundreds of GBs)\n    * Running an archive node is not necessary to sync from genesis and verify blocks and transactions.\n    * A full node has all the information enough to generate an archive node.\n    * There are plans on [the roadmap](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/vXMaIyZ.png) to reduce the storage\/bandwidth\/RAM requirements of nodes even more, to a point where a smartphone will be able to independently verify and propagate new blocks. \n\n5. There is no \"when eth2 rolls out\" or \"when devs release eth2\" or god forbid \"when ethereum is upgraded to 2.0\". What there is instead is a roadmap consisting of a series of upgrades aiming to help rollups \u2013 *not the base layer* \u2013 scale to hundreds of thousands of TPS.\n    * Depending on context, Eth1 is usually synonymous with \"execution layer\" and Eth2 usually means \"consensus layers\" ([helpful illustration](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/AHHcUgm.png)) otherwise \"eth2\" is an umbrella term for the set of upgrades over a long period of time, but the fact remains that there is no specific instant in time where \"eth1 turns into eth2\".\n    * Similarly, there is no \"eth2\" coin. ETH is ETH, you don't have to do anything, the coins you hold today will be the same after the switch to proof of stake.\n\n6. Unlocking staked Ether [will not cause a mass sell-off event](https:\/\/twitter.com\/domothy\/status\/1467387422765953029). There is a limited withdrawing queue, it's not gonna happen all at once. And there are many more reasons for more people to start staking Ether than there are for the current stakers to exit en masse.\n    * Also, unlocking staked Ether will not be possible directly after the merge. Withdrawals will be enable in the first fork that follows the merge ~6 months later.\n\n7. There are plenty of options to avoid high gas fees, it's perfectly fine to use a sidechain to do your DeFi stuff for now. I use sidechains myself too. Just don't pretend these sidechains will replace Ethereum in any significant way as that's not even what they're trying to do.\n\n8. Switching to Proof of Stake [will not lower Layer 1 gas fees significantly](https:\/\/willthemergelowergasprices.org\/). Anyone saying otherwise is either misinformed or trying to mislead you into false expectations to bank on the inevitable mass disappointment following the merge.\n    * It's still a monumental upgrade that will render possible much-needed upgrades like light clients, statelessness, and sharding, etc. that would otherwise be impossible or impractical to implement on the current proof of work chain.\n    * It's basically a way to \"start from scratch\" while keeping the same coin, same users, same dapps, same network effects.\n    * PoS has been on the roadmap [since day 1](https:\/\/blog.ethereum.org\/2015\/03\/03\/ethereum-launch-process\/). Yes, estimates of PoS dates have been wrong before. However right now it's all hands on deck on the merge, the spec is done, the beacon chain is running, there is a [merge testnet running](https:\/\/blog.ethereum.org\/2021\/12\/20\/kintsugi-merge-testnet\/), it's happening.\n\n9. Sharding will not lower Layer 1 gas fees significantly either. Sharding is all about *data*, execution on Layer 1 will still be limited and expensive. What data sharding will do is help rollups (Layer 2) scale by several orders of magnitude.\n\n10. [Rollups](https:\/\/mirror.xyz\/ethmaxitard.eth\/iyCAlOexgQKOvoSAAk4utYGEdnESOKb5HstM2_LaqL4) are [already live today](https:\/\/l2beat.com\/) and they will only [get cheaper](https:\/\/l2fees.info\/) as more people use them.\n\n11. [Data sharding + rollups is the only sustainable way](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethfinance\/comments\/pk57n7\/why_rollups_data_shards_are_the_only_sustainable\/) to scale a blockchain globally without compromising decentralization.\n    * \"Sustainable\" as in the overall security model doesn't rely on hoping that the coin's price will pump forever to outpace the dilution from the blockchain issuing way more new coins than they collect in fees. Something that all major blockchains (including Ethereum most days, and even Bitcoin) are currently doing.\n    * \"Without compromising decentralization\" as in more decentralization = more data for rollups = more scaling (lower individual fees on L2). Decentralization becomes an integral part of the scaling equation rather than a crutch.\n    * [The rollup-centric roadmap](https:\/\/ethereum-magicians.org\/t\/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap\/4698) is all about admitting that no single blockchain can do it all by itself and can't compete with what rollups can do. In other words, \"Ethereum maximalism\" amounts to helping independent teams develop rollups, innovate and compete with each other on top of Ethereum's secure, decentralized, and open platform.\n    * The true competition of sidechains is rollups, not Ethereum itself. \n    * All the criticisms of a multi-rollup world apply to the current multi-chain world model as well. Except they apply way more to the multi-chain world and can be overcome way more easily in a multi-rollup world.\n    * A rollup can settle on any L1, sure, but it's gonna gravitate towards the most secure, most decentralized and most credibly neutral settlement layer with the best data availability. Right now only Bitcoin and Ethereum fit those criteria (other L1s optimize for fast execution, not secure data availability) and Bitcoin would need a hard fork to implement rollup-friendly functions, so that only leaves Ethereum as the poised [\"AWS for blockchain\"](https:\/\/twitter.com\/domothy\/status\/1465905887541972996).\n\n12. Ether isn't meant to be a day-to-day currency that will replace fiat. The use-case of Ether isn't to pay for bread and milk, it's to pay for gas fees and secure the network. All the other use-cases derive from Ether's scarcity, but they're not strictly necessary.\n    * Having Ether be an appreciating asset is good for the overall long-term health of the network by providing it with more [economic security, its holders more economic bandwidth](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/AErfdod.png), and its users more reasons to hold\/stake. The incoming deflation is good.\n    * However, the supply is not gonna be deflationary forever. The market dictates how much the blockspace is worth (so how much gets burned) and it also dictates how much the staking APR should be (so how much gets printed) so these two opposing forces will meet in the middle at some point. It's all about [them feedback loops](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/3bPV35a.png).\n\n13. The security model trumps the economic model. The core idea behind the economic model is: \"[Minimum viable issuance to secure the network](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethfinance\/comments\/izhkvk\/minimum_viable_issuance_why_ethereums_lack_of_a\/)\". It was designed from the start to be [disinflationary](https:\/\/blog.ethereum.org\/2014\/04\/10\/the-issuance-model-in-ethereum\/) (as in, inflation % terms goes down over time) with even the idea of fee burning being mentioned in [early](https:\/\/blog.ethereum.org\/2016\/07\/27\/inflation-transaction-fees-cryptocurrency-monetary-policy\/) publications and [FAQ](https:\/\/github.com\/ethereum\/wiki\/wiki\/Proof-of-Stake-FAQ\/ba766606790d80422b23650d3326e2d963bdfa87)\n\n14. It's okay to change or tweak things when new research indicates there's a problem with long-term sustainability or security of the current model. These changes don't happen \"on a whim of a few people\", there's a lot of consideration that go into them.\n    * And remember, changes happen in a highly adversarial context. If there's *any* possibility of an upgrade causing security problems or being exploited in any way for profit, then it *will* happen. Changes don't just happen for fun \"just because\", they happen when their benefits outweigh the inherent risks of potentially adding more complexity.\n\n15. The Ethereum Foundation is more of a [coordinator than a dictator](https:\/\/ethereum.foundation\/philosophy\/). It's much more of a community-focused bottom-up approach than the top-down structure people think.\n    * Everything happens extremely transparently on open forums that no one reads and [public livestream calls](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/EthereumFoundation\/videos) that no one listens to. But everyone who wants to participate is welcome, it's all out in the open.\n    * The Ethereum Foundation doesn't code any of the actual software, client teams do. There are 5 major execution clients and 4 major consensus clients, developed by independent teams, to implement the protocol specification. This multi-client approach may be responsible for development delays, but it comes with [security benefits](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethereum\/comments\/mreacw\/psa_the_importance_of_multiclient_and_why_the\/)\n    * [Anyone can propose an Ethereum Improvement Proposal](https:\/\/ethereum.org\/en\/eips\/). You just have to convince others it's a good idea to implement it (most EIPs don't get implemented and fall into obscurity) and the clients could just refuse to code it in if it's a very bad idea. The more time passes, the harder it becomes to push changes to the Ethereum protocol and everything converges to the status quo. (This doesn't close the door to further innovation however, as it's still an open platform on which anyone can build)\n    * Vitalik regularly gets his proposals blocked by client teams, other researchers, or the community in general. At most, he's a knowledgeable influence because he knows the tech and cryptography in depth and has been there from the beginning. It's silly to worship him, and it's silly to treat him as Ethereum's Zucc-like CEO. He's \"just some guy\".\n\n16. The \"[DAO hard fork](https:\/\/eips.ethereum.org\/EIPS\/eip-779)\" wasn't a roll-back. Not a single transaction was reverted, no one lost any funds other than the exploiter who could have otherwise gotten away with [15% of the total supply at the time](https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/learn\/2016\/06\/25\/understanding-the-dao-attack\/). It wasn't a bailout of Vitalik and his pals, it was a bailout of a huge chunk of the community from an event that could have killed the whole thing in its infancy. \n    * In the end it's all social consensus, and the consensus from miners, users, developers was strong. Even \"code is law\" is social consensus that [can get reverted in case of major bugs](https:\/\/en.bitcoin.it\/wiki\/Value_overflow_incident). It's all about what the community deems [legitimate](https:\/\/vitalik.ca\/general\/2021\/03\/23\/legitimacy.html).\n    * *edit: see comments for more nuance on this point*\n\n17. As far as the [initial distribution](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/k3GB8Lh.png) goes, Ethereum's ICO is among [the best of those who had an ICO](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/fmW3ytf.png), and as far as the current distribution goes (after 6 years of proof of work and market movements), it's [on par with Bitcoin's](https:\/\/medium.com\/@adamscochran\/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb). 60m of the 72m \"pre-mined\" coins went to a permissionless no-KYC sale, and [all the genesis transactions are included in Block #0](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/txs?block=0) so you can check yourself that there's no hidden coins. Just like Bitcoin, early investors took on big risks and got big rewards. No surprises here. Any concerns of the ICO being a scam or rugpull should have vanished some time in 2015, yet here we are still talking about it for some reason.\n    * And if coin distribution is a concern to you because proof of stake, then you should be glad the DAO hack didn't end up with a single person owning 15% of the supply...\n    * *edit: see comments for more nuance on this point too lol*\n\n18. There is no \"technical debt\" preventing Ethereum from scaling.\n\n19. EIP-1559 was [not meant to lower gas fees](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210205013340\/https:\/\/willeip1559lowergasprices.org\/) and no credible person ever promised it was a scaling solution.\n    * It has [many benefits](https:\/\/domothy.com\/eip1559\/) beyond coin burning. The deflation is a nice side effect, and it's certainly not a gimmick meant to pump the price.\n\n20. Proof of Work is really just Proof of Stake with extra steps.\n    * In both systems, the goal is reach consensus in a sybil-resistant way. Spending time and energy by computing hashes over and over is just the easiest way to reach that goal. But if we can achieve that goal (randomness + verifiable delay functions) without using the energy of a continent, maybe we should look into it.\n    * In both systems, whoever has capital gets to earn more capital by producing more blocks. (Except in Proof of Stake, everyone earns at the same rate, proportional to how much they stake)\n    * In both systems, the capital that someone has at stake (mining rigs vs coins directly) is a good indicative that they will play by the rules.\n    * By design, [Ethereum doesn't have on-chain governance](https:\/\/docs.ethhub.io\/ethereum-basics\/governance\/#on-chain-governance). This means that the people with the most coins can't change the rules under PoS any more than the people with the most hash rate can change the rules under PoW.\n    * Just like there are mining pools, there are staking pools. As usual, some options are [more decentralized and community-focused](https:\/\/rocketpool.net\/) than others."

If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.\n\n**When is Eth2 launching?**\n\nEth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. \"The Merge\", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.\n\nVisit [ethmerge.com](https:\/\/ethmerge.com\/) to learn more about \"The Merge\".\n\n**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**\n\nNo, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.\n\n**How can I stake my ETH?**\n\nThere are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.\n\n* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit \/r\/ethstaker for more details\n* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https:\/\/lido.fi\/) or [StakeWise](https:\/\/stakewise.io\/)\n\n**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**\n\nLike most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.\n\n**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**\n\nEthereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.\n\nAdditionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.\n\nWhile rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https:\/\/l2beat.com\/) to learn more about rollups.\n\n**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**\n\nThe most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre there questions you'd like to see added? Leave a comment below."

        "text": "Hello and good afternoon, I made coffee earlier and called a place I recently applied at to follow up, and the hiring manager was not there at the moment. I thought nothing of it, oh I'll just call back later. I went to take a sip of coffee, then I was struck with an idea. Now here I am beginning to write this article, alone, with my thoughts and feelings. I mean my dog is here too. My dog and I, and my coffee. Noice. Anyways..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I have been in the crypto space since 2019 and was using [Crypto.com](https:\/\/Crypto.com) before they got all these like brand deals and did these collabs with all these industries. Back when you had to stake MCO to upgrade, (which I never was able to upgrade to Ruby because I guess I didn't do it right and it was in the middle of them switching to CRO, whatever), was doing stonks, forex, options, but nothing has ever helped or made me more happy than Crypto. All the jobs I worked at, I was always talking about crypto or the blockchain, And any job I work at I take a certain percentage of each check and buy BTC (starting to buy ETH more since I've been getting into NFTs) because I am big bullish on crypto and I am very excited for the future of crypto. That leads me to my next point. Working in the crypto market\/community would be a fuckin dream come true. I do not like \"Fiat' anymore. I want to be bank-less. Cash is trash. The Feds are just printing money like nothing and there's people out there going hungry and we get taxed on literally everything. Savings accounts, 401k, stocks, \"fiat\" are trash, in my opinion of course (calm down keyboard warriors, I'm not here for a debate, save it) and I do not want to work somewhere that restricts me in being me and being a creative. It would be consistent yes which anybody can agree would be the better option, but so is the crypto space. More and more projects and communities are being built everyday. I am actually working on my first hand drawn NFT collection right now, one of many. Being able to network and collab with the crypto\/NFT community full time would be great, it would literally change my life. I'd be able to die happy knowing I made a difference in society and the economy just being in the cryptospace and clear up all the confusion and common misconceptions about crypto and NFTs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith all that being said, I am looking for a potential job in the cryptospace. I am looking to work for experience and later, paid in BTC or ETH. I have some coding experience, been drawing since I was in grade school, and I can pick things up fairly quickly. I do have a lengthy (outdated) resume because I had to move around a lot, unfortunately. Introvert who likes to think 3 moves ahead, sometimes overthinking a little too much. Like to be the first one there, last one to leave. I can do anything, if I don't know how to do it I will learn. I am not afraid of a challenge and do not use the words \"I can't\" I do not believe in them. I am still in the process of updating my resume it's way outdated, but I've been waiting over two weeks for a background check from a company that I really don't like. I quit my last job because it literally felt like I was wasting my time and skills. Got scheduled an interview literally the next day and got sent an offer same day because the hiring manager was hyped that I was applying there and wanted to hire me ASAP but said I have to do the background check which should only take like 3-4 days.. 5 days max. But 16 days?? (11 business days) for a background check? C'mon now.. I do have the Wonolo and Veryable app too so I can make some extra bucks here and there. I want to do this for the experience, the networking, the community, the hype, the future of crypto, and for the people. I want to contribute in any way, shape or form that I can in helping the economy and making this a better place. Any NFT projects you working on that you need help with? Or maybe a company that needs talent. Something, anything. If I'm gonna be trading my time for money, then I at least want it to be crypto related or paid in crypto. I can send an updated resume by Wednesday, Jan. 26th. Thank you for your time. \n\n(Tried posting this in r\/CryptoCurrency and I guess I don't have enough comment karma)\n\n(Side Note): This is my first article, like ever. If you like it and want me to write (or type) more, let me know. This was fun. I would appreciate any feedback, Thanks again. \n\n(Also accepting donations to help pay for a new pc, anything would help and be greatly appreciated. Thank you!)"

We keep silver in our own posession. But in addition, we will need a silver wire-transfer without counterparty risk.\n\nSay I want to pay some ounces of silver to a target 1000 miles away. I ask the crypto-system to arrange that. It tells me to meet with someone who is 1 mile away, that person gives me a hash that I can immediately verify, i give the ounces plus a fee. 1000 miles away the target gets a notice containing another hash and arranges a meeting with someone 1 mile away to get the ounces for that hash.\n\nWe don't need a banking system for that. The counterparty risk is limited to the amount we transfer and only for the duration of the transfer.\n\nNote that these tens of thousands of silver-investors do not want to learn the ins and outs of smart contracts, we want something that \\*just works\\*.\n\nMy initial thoughts on this focused on coin-shop owners who could play the role of the two intermediates: they could exchange silver with Ethereum. But that is a foolish route to consider: They have huge interest in keeping the current system going. When selling they charge us 20% premium. And taxes apply because in most countries coinshop implies company implies taxes. We want a barter-system (taxless like a yard-sale) between the smart-contract world and the physical silver world."

The creators of Flappy Inu believe combining gaming and crypto will become the future of gaming. In preparation for this, they are aiming to bring back the popular game flappy bird with a few Shiba-like modifications. The flappy bird in the game for example is a Shiba bird. It is an intelligent strategy employed to market video games and crypto together in a subtle but intriguing way. The game is now available on their website.\n\nNow what?\n\nHere is a direct quote from their white paper \u201cOn a smaller scale Flap aims to develop the most popular decentralized crypto gaming ecosystem, FlapWorld, where Flap will be the main currency\u201d. Users will be able to access features and levels within the game by holding Flap and NFTs created by Yoshi and the team\u201d. They have multiple developments and a lot of bold claims. They say you are going to be able to connect your wallet to the game and if you hold certain tokens the game will change by adding new levels and features. Which I think is pretty cool.\n\nHow is it not a scam?\n\nOn their website, they have posted the burn of half their supply on Etherscan. They have burnt their LP tokens and have posted on their website the Etherscan link. Essentially ensuring that it is impossible to rug pull. They also go into great detail on how they are transparent on their whitepaper. Saying everything they do will be public and the community will have a say.\n\nWhat is my opinion?\n\nI think the creators have created something special. Flappy Inu has a fun and intriguing platform to attract users of all backgrounds. Staying ahead of the future trends in gaming and crypto is hard, but not impossible. Flappy Inu presents a relatively easy low-risk opportunity to get ahead of the curve as there is a particularly large market for gaming tokens like Flappy Inu to grow exponentially as crypto does. Finally, who doesn't love a flappy Shiba bird?"

        "text": "We provide over 100+ FREE crypto articles on our SubStack! :D (Link on our profile). This is not financial advice.\n\n  \n\n**TLDR**:\n\nWe can see that the Play-To-Earn trend is growing strongly, especially in the current market situation, both owning NFT (True Ownership) characters and valuable token rewards. , but can that happen in the long-term when the cash flow has already begun to \"stagnate\".\n\nWith the blockchain being widely recognised, it is possible that many large funds will start to participate in this game, the money may flow in the future & NFT Gaming projects are one of the most popular categories. The attraction and potential of Play To Earn projects are feasible, but not in the short term and depends on each project.\n\n# General Conclusion\n\nThe NFT market is a rather modest field when its appeal is limited to simple gaming. You buy an item and expect it to be worth more in the future, but it lacks the interactivity between the player and the game.\n\n2021 can be said to be a \"Welcome to the World of Play To Earn\" year because it has opened up a wave of NFT gaming trends with a lot of positive information surrounding it also created many record numbers in the crypto market.\n\nLeading the way for deeper game interaction is the Axies project and following many other NFT projects participating in the \"play2earn\" game that has brought the entire Ethereum network to life. Since then, many new projects have begun to expand across other Chains to optimise costs and bring more interesting experiences.\n\n# What Is Play2Earn?\n\n## Concept\n\nPlay-To-Earn is a combination of two actions Play & Earn, which means both playing games and earning money. Gaming has been around since the 1970s, each phase has a face of innovation & in 2021, a unique combination of NFT and traditional gaming takes place, giving users (both crypto & non-crypto) a unique experience. new play to earn experience.\n\nPlay to Earn has been around for a long time, for many 8x, 9x generation gamers, the game Silk Road is a good example, you can transform into simulation characters, fight & raise account rank, buy and sell weapons, participate in hunting prizes, etc. If you can \"plow\" to become a terrible level, many powerful weapons can be sold to make money.\n\n## What Is Different About Play2Earn In Crypto 2021?\n\nThanks to blockchain technology and the advantages of the Crypto market, the Play to Earn model has now been improved, specifically:\n\n* Gaming operators have incorporated NFT in their protocol.\n* Improve ownership of in-game assets for users.\n* Players are creating value for other players and developers, in return they are rewarded with in-game assets (native tokens\/NFTs).\n\n \n\n# Axies Infinity ($AXS)\n\n \n\nWith a play-to-earn model, Axie Infinity is a name that brings a new wave with successful development in the past time. This is a Crypto project conceived by Vietnamese team & launched in 2018. Axie Infinity is built on Loom Network - a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. Inspired by the popular game series Pok\u00e9mon and CryptoKitties, players in Axie also need to do quests, battle, and exchange items with other users at the Marketplace.\n\nEach Axie in the game can be purchased and owned as NFT (Non-fungible token), the player needs to raise them with $SLP (Small love potions). NFT & $SLP items are all exchangeable to $AXS and trade them for profit.\n\nGame Axie Infinity is played not only for fun but also for money, these criteria have affected the majority of Filipinos. In particular, during the Covid 19 epidemic season, Axie's hotness spread even more. From the elderly to young children, everyone downloads & plays games to earn money, which has helped Filipinos have a great source of income in the most difficult time.\n\nAXS is a utility token representing Axie Infinity that serves as an in-game reward & exchange item."

How can people optimize their time and learn key functionalities of cryptocurrency in a low-stress and passive environment? \n\nIntroducing: Etherlands - Minecraft on the blockchain. Using a popular Web2 application, GFX Labs has developed a bridge to simplify the connection to Web3 which has led to an inclusive and easy-to-use app. Similar to other GameFi projects, Etherlands allows you to claim plots on-chain, using the Polygon Network, without paying a network\/gas fee. Plots have fully customizable permissions using our proprietary \u201cTowns\u201d system. \n\nIn addition to not having network\/gas fees, all land is currently free as Etherlands is currently doing a playtest. Land purchased during this period will be wiped before the mainnet launch - however, it has been hinted that users that participate in this test will get something prior to launch. This means that to participate in the Etherlands playtest, you will only need to own Minecraft: Java Edition - no MATIC or any type of money is needed.\n\nIn-game experience: Explore and discover Etherlands, build, create, and destroy others in a limitless world of challenge. Survive the night, establish towns, and unleash your creativity with add-ons such as NFT Paintings that can display NFT\u2019s using OpenSea\u2019s API (with more API support coming soon). View your land on all four sides with our exclusive 3D renders, viewable on our homepage and other NFT marketplaces.

According to Teden, bitcoin mining has become a \"national problem\" in Sweden. He added that cryptocurrencies jeopardize the fulfillment of the climate goals of the Paris Agreement. According to Teden, European regulators need to think about banning mining using the Proof-of-Work mechanism and allow only cryptocurrencies using Proof-of-Stake, since they require less energy consumption."

For those of you who are unaware it's a virtual card game based on the anime Yu-Gi-Oh!. Well anyways I was watching the stream and I made a comment stating that It would be great if it were NFT based and worked on a Blockchain! I've been playing another Blockchain based card game called Splinterlands and I have lots of fun trading cards buying and selling and just thought it would be amazing to have Yu-Gi-Oh! On a blockchain as well. You know to actually own the cards and be able to buy and sell as you please. Well they finally read my comment and seemed really reluctant to the idea and took a poll in the comment section. They said comment 1 if you think it's a good idea and 2 if you don't think it's a good idea. It was flooded with an overwhelming amount of 2's and I really don't think they understand all of the amazing possibilities than can come with being on a Blockchain.I truly believe It is the future of gaming and it hurt seeing so many people ignorant to the idea just because of all the bad press nfts get. We need to do our part to tell people about all the amazing aspects of Crypto currency and Blockchain as a technology and not just some way to get rich quick. I for one already have one of my friends who reached out to me and I introduced him into this amazing world as well as my brother and his father. We are still very early you guys have an amazing day much love to you all."

We build the tech stack where every time a credit card is swiped or the register is opened, it\u2019s recorded in real time live on chain. I\u2019d also like to live tweet and use a discord to let everyone know the decisions being made. That wouldn\u2019t necessarily be for the decision making aspects of the business but just for the utmost transparency so I can prove DAOs in real business would work.\n\nBased on the equity, DAO supporters would get the net profits on more than likely a quarterly basis.\n\nOverall, I\u2019m a business operator, so I don\u2019t know the technical logistics of building the smart contracts. Any devs that join in and help build this thing will be incentivized as well.\n\nPlease reach out and we can build a team and get this thing going. I have the marketing to raise the DAO nearly ready, I quite literally just need a Dev to build the contract."

I want to learn how to make production-ready DApps I can use for commercial projects. How to do local testing with dev tools, make my own test blockchain (with ganache I think?) and how to make the same DApps for other networks. I want to get into ERC-20\/721\/1155 tokens and learn how to interact contracts with eachother (i.e. reward NFT holders with tokens), or how crypto kitties did breeding, learn how to do liquidity pools, bridges, DAOs, and everything that's trending right now.\n\nWhere is the best place to start? I see a 16 hour youtube video that looks good, but I'm not sure if this will meet my needs. I have a very solid programming background and just want to learn about, specifically: the dev tools for testing, the production-ready techniques, the BIG NEW concepts & implementations, and interaction between smart contracts.

If you want to take part in anything on the Ethereum network you basically can't move it without spending crazy Money. It doesn't make sense. For example I put $200 in MYOBU about a month ago on MEXC. Lost majority of it when I transferred it to my Coinbase wallet thinking it would be okay because I planned on stalking it. Only to find out I had to spend another $50 in gas fee's just to stake it. Then once I hit stake it took my gas fee but I'm not sure if it even staked. My Coinbase wallet still shows my MYOBU but it has no value or price next to it"

IF AND ONLY IF we all started at the same starting point.\n\nThe problem with capitalism today is that some people are simply born more fortunate and that puts them significantly ahead of the curve.\n\nAs capitalism suggests, it requires capital. There are 2 ways we make a living today \u2014 using capital to earn wages or using labour to earn wages. For example, allowing your land to work for you by receiving rental on land (capital) or using your time to work for you by receiving wages on time basis (labour).\n\n# Evolution of Capital\n\nWhile we think of capital as land, money or other fixed assets, the good news is that capital is about to change.\n\nThe capital of the future lies in **digital capital**. It could be digital tools like algorithms, quant-finance models or machine learning tools. Hence, going down this path, you'd realise that the evolution of capital tend towards those with existing capital to begin with.\n\nThe amount of capital, resources, time and skills required to build a quant-finance model is not something you can find on the street. Thus, this becomes disadvantageous to people exchanging labour for wages.\n\n>This enhances the inequality that we see today.\n\n# Open-source Web 3 to the rescue\n\nThis is where tokens, web3 and open-sourced system come into the picture.\n\n>In short, we are making these digital capital available for everyone\n\nHow? The code, mechanisms, math, algorithm, general smart contract code are all open-sourced and available to use. This levels out the playing field and allows everyone to start on the same point.\n\nInstead of struggling to get the digital capital, the digital capital is open-sourced and available for anyone to use.\n\n>The key now becomes \"how do I use these resources available?\"\n\nIn the book, we guide you through the economic principles to be considered and how the various mechanisms are used in DeFi. Together, they form the foundation to use these digital resources available and build a robust internal economy.\n\nMore specifically, read chapters 2 and 3 for the evolution of economics and understand the new ways of coordination and incentives in a tokenised economy."

        "text": "**Ethereum Rollup NFT Platforms**\n\nI almost didn't want to post this one since it's a lot more bare than the DeFi posts, but I told someone I would so here it is. It turns out finding NFT platforms is more difficult than finding DeFi apps, or there are just a lot fewer of them. So, what I\u2019d like to do is start a list and then add whatever platforms the comments suggest, if any. I\u2019ll add pretty much any suggested platform as long as it is 1) on an Ethereum rollup and 2) operational and ready for use now. \n\n**Arbitrum**\n\n* [TreasureDAO and $MAGIC](https:\/\/www.treasure.lol\/) - Treasure is a decentralized NFT ecosystem on Arbitrum that is built specifically for metaverse projects. Treasure projects are linked\u2013narratively and economically\u2013through MAGIC. The DAO uses MAGIC emissions to grow new projects and continue supporting more mature ones. I believe there will be a \u201cBridgeworld\u201d game attached to the DAO as well, in addition to the Treasure NFT marketplace.\n* [NFT Alliance](https:\/\/www.nftalliance.xyz\/#projects) \u2013 A collective of various NFT applications and collections.\n* [ImpishDAO](https:\/\/impishdao.com\/impishdao) \u2013 A DAO formed to win the RandomwalkNFT prize, it has now expanded to create additional derivative NFT collections\n* [Agora](https:\/\/agoranft.io\/) - A colorful NFT marketplace platform with plans to become a DAO\n* [Out of Orbit](https:\/\/outoforbit.art\/) - another NFT marketplace on Arbitrum\n\n**Optimism**\n\n* [Quixotic](https:\/\/quixotic.io\/) - Optimism-native NFT marketplace, includes projects such as Optimistic bunnies, optipunks, and OE.\n* [Dope Wars](https:\/\/dopewars.gg\/) - This is listed on Optimism\u2019s gateway page, but the Dope Wars site says it\u2019s on StarkNet. IDK which it is, but since StarkNet is in Alpha I\u2019ll default it to OE.\n\n**Boba**\n\n* As of right now, the only NFT platform I can find on Boba is [TofuNFT](https:\/\/tofunft.com\/), which is a dapp on nearly every chain. There are two projects listed on the Boba gateway: Boba Punks and Boba Apes.\n\n**Metis**\n\n* [Metacraft](https:\/\/metacraft.pro\/allnfts) \u2013 A multi-chain NFT marketplace supporting Metis\n\n**zkSync**\n\n* zkSync doesn\u2019t have full EVM compatibility yet, so the only NFT app available is the built-in wallet minting function: https:\/\/wallet.zksync.io\/account\/nft\n\n**ImmutableX**\n\n* [ImmutableX](https:\/\/market.x.immutable.com\/) is a huge hub for NFTs, especially NFT games. Also powers Veve, the platform which hosts Disney\u2019s digital collectibles market. Probably the most notable project on Immutable is Gods Unchained, a trading card game."

With this post, I attempt to introduce you to what it is, what it does, and why it\u2019s different.**\n\n#First off, a little refresher. What are zk rollups?\n\nIn very simple words, **a zk rollup takes thousands of transactions off the Ethereum main chain, executes them off-chain, takes the results and rolls them up into a single transaction which is accompanied by a validity proof.** This validity proof guarantees cryptographically that all transactions have been executed with integrity, or in other words: there is no possibility of fraudulent transactions. By rolling up thousands of transactions into one single transaction, they can achieve unprecedented scalability, and nearly limitless computational capacity (cheap computation). \n\nThe validity proof that accompanies the transaction is either a SNARK (succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge) or a STARK (scalable transparent argument of knowledge). As the name implies, STARKs have some advantages over SNARKs, namely:\n\n* no trusted ceremony (sometimes required for SNARKs)\n* more scalable than SNARKs: higher effective TPS and throughput ceiling\n* future proof technology: STARKs are quantum resistant\n\nYou can read more about SNARKs vs STARKs [in this excellent article](https:\/\/mirror.xyz\/pseudotheos.eth\/_LAi4cCFz2gaC-3WgNmri1eTvckA32L7v31A8saJvqg).\n\nAs the name implies, **StarkNet is a zk rollup that utilizes STARKs.** Since rollups are execution layers (where smart contracts live and are executed), they need a programming language for developers to build dApps with. Most rollups shoot for EVM-compatibility to be able to support Solidity, the most widely used language in dApp development. And StarkNet supports Solidity too, via a Solidity-to-Cairo transpiler. \n\n**Wait, what\u2019s Cairo?** Cairo is a new language. It has been created specifically for use with STARKs - Solidity is not optimized for this new paradigm of extremely cheap and complex computation. By adapting your dApp code to Cairo, you can unlock tons of new functionality that simply wasn\u2019t possible on Layer 1 (Ethereum mainnet). One example for this would be dYdX, a decentralized perpetuals exchange powered by StarkWare\u2019s tech, which is capable of sub-second oracle updates, cross-margin settlements involving more than 10 synthetic assets, and much more. [Further reading here](https:\/\/medium.com\/starkware\/a-thundering-herd-the-rise-of-l2-native-dapps-290598f6477f).\n\nBy this time, you can already see why StarkNet is criminally under the radar on this sub - a lot of this stuff goes over people\u2019s heads. But you should know that some of the brightest minds in the entire L2 space are working on StarkNet. **Don\u2019t believe me? Let\u2019s explore the blossoming ecosystem a bit.**\n\n* **Aave v3** (new version that hasn\u2019t released yet) will be [ported to StarkNet](https:\/\/governance.aave.com\/t\/arc-deploying-aave-on-starknet\/6726)\n* **Snapshot Labs** (the most used voting tool for governance of DAOs) is [introducing Snapshot X](https:\/\/snapshot.mirror.xyz\/cUOrwdtEs5PvNh0sqYWWxPjt8GdJWn_Qp3cl7E3_8IU) to be deployed on StarkNet\n* Aave [will integrate Snapshot X](https:\/\/governance.aave.com\/t\/arc-aave-governance-v3\/6980?u=0xbilll) into their governance processes \n* **MakerDAO** will [mint DAI directly on StarkNet](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MakerGrowth\/status\/1481316075509792770)\n* **dYdX** is a perpetuals exchange that [has done higher volume](https:\/\/cryptonews.com\/news\/dydx-soars-as-protocol-sees-trading-volume-double-that-of-coinbase.htm) than most CEX exchanges, and its [protocol revenue](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FJbjtO7UUAAUe-a?format=jpg&name=large) is on an absolute tear.\n* **ImmutableX** is a rollup instance built with StarkWare\u2019s tech that specializes in NFTs and gaming and is seeing massive growth in activity, has been adopted by [ESL](https:\/\/www.eslgaming.com\/article\/esl-partners-immutable-x-launch-next-generation-digital-nft-collectible-platform-csgo-fans-worldwide-4439), [Ecomi](https:\/\/medium.com\/ecomi\/ecomi-x-immutable-migration-start-here-b275b91fe7b0) (Veve - official tradeable NFTs for Disney, Marvel etc universes), [TikTok](https:\/\/tiktok.immutable.com\/), and many more.\n* **[SoRare](https:\/\/sorare.com\/)**, a fantasy football NFT game.\n\nAnd the list goes on and on. **Akropolis**, **ZigZag** (a DEX built specifically for zk rollups to take advantage of their additional capabilities), but also games like **[Briqs](https:\/\/twitter.com\/briqNFT)** (Minecraft-like), **[DopeWars](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TheDopeWars)** (mafia RPG with in-game economy and tokens), **[Influence](https:\/\/twitter.com\/influenceth)** (Space MMORPG), **[Loot Realms](https:\/\/twitter.com\/LootRealms)** (an extension to the OG Loot game project on Ethereum), etc. As if that wasn't enough, **you can actually store graphics on-chain and [even code a physics engine on-chain](https:\/\/twitter.com\/guiltygyoza\/status\/1449637155001798657)** because of the extremely cheap computation enabled by zk rollups. Let that sink in.\n\n**An incomplete list of publicly known projects is [here](https:\/\/starkware.notion.site\/Projects-Building-on-StarkNet-a33dee55778a4515a9be9bdae02ee682).**\n\nBeyond that, StarkNet is collaborating with the Nethermind team (creators of the Ethereum Nethermind node client) on the Solidity -> Cairo [transpiler](https:\/\/medium.com\/nethermind-eth\/warp-your-way-to-starknet-ddd6856875e0), and with Tim Roughgarden (a game theory prof who checked over EIP-1559\u2019s game theory soundness) on a fee mechanism for StarkNet.\n\n#Oh, and by the way.. Layer 3 is a thing. Yep. How? Why? I\u2019ll explain.\n\n**Layer 3 is essentially a rollup on top of a rollup.** A rollup can verify the STARK proofs of another rollup built on top. That would be called a \u201crecursive\u201d proof. By doing this, you can achieve scalability gains of up to 1,000,000x. You heard that right. So if you have a dApp that needs truly massive scalability, you can build it on Layer 3. More info in [this great blog post](https:\/\/medium.com\/starkware\/fractal-scaling-from-l2-to-l3-7fe238ecfb4f). \n\n**So why is StarkNet so underrepresented on this sub? Two reasons:**\n\n1. zk rollups are complicated to wrap one\u2019s head around\n2. there is no token (yet?)\n\n#Now you know about StarkNet, a major player in the Ethereum Layer 2 rollup space. But what\u2019s next for StarkNet?\n\n* data availability solutions (called Volition) which enables even cheaper transactions\n* decentralized sequencers and provers (potentially by the end of this year)\n* L2 full nodes for full permissionlessness\n* Layer 3 deployments (**SoRare** will port their platform to L3 soon, as well as **dYdX**)\n\n**zk rollups are still maturing, so over the course of 2022, we\u2019ll see a blossoming ecosystem with many new additions, protocol mechanisms fleshed out, a path to credible decentralization, and lots and lots of innovations both on the dApp side with Cairo, as well as on the zk tech side with Layer 3 and other breakthroughs.**\n\n#TLDR: StarkNet is a major player in the Ethereum L2 space, pushing the boundaries on blockchain tech and taking the dev community by storm."

Justin Sun (founder of Tron) even put up billboards with the words \"The world's largest decentralised ecosystem\" to which even Vitialik mocked him ([source](https:\/\/cdn.coingape.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/01142955\/Screen-Shot-2019-04-01-at-2.29.22-pm.png)). Tron had moved to Proof of Stake and everyone in this forums and other forums screamed centralisation and how the stakers could easily be compromised and the giving authority to a staking government system lent itself to the same flaws that occur in politics - and not only that that if the system itself that was the primary proof of state was compromised then the blockchain could be corrupted from a single point of failure (hence same risks that occur with centralisation).\n\nSo my question is, why is it that Tron was considered centralised with the exact same codebase as Ethereum, except the addition of Proof of Stake, but when Ethereum (Eth2.0) moves to Proof of Strake none of those same centralisation issues \/ risks exist anymore?"

This is not financial advice.\n\n  \n\n**TLDR:**\n\nCommon goods are goods that are for everyone to use like parks, libraries, and oxygen. In the physical world, common goods are destroyed because no one has the incentive to take care of them. Today in the DeFi world it can be different because we have an incentive to want to take care of them. Participatory economics functions via a token-based ecosystem where the token is an incentive to affect people's behaviors and encourage them to do good in these public goods that we are creating.\n\n# What are common goods?\n\n**Public Goods:**\u00a0There is a little bit more of a barrier here as you need to fit certain criteria to join this space like a country club where you need to get memberships or you need to have X amount of qualifications or X amount of attributes to be able to join this public goods community.  \n\n\n**Common goods:** On the other hand, common goods are goods that are for everyone to use so you don't need to be a superstar or a supermodel and everyone like you and me can just join and enjoy it. Examples of common goods in the real physical world are parks, libraries, and oxygen. These are infrastructures given either by the world like water or built by a country system or a nation-state like parks and libraries.\n\nLesson one in economics is that there's no such thing as free lunch and there's an opportunity cost to everything.\n\n## Incentive Misalignment: How do common goods fall into this category of no such thing as free lunch?\n\nCommon goods are very difficult to maintain. For example, water is free for everyone to use but look at all the water pollution that occurs. If you look at who is cleaning up the water or who is taking care of these common goods you will see that not many people are doing that because they are not incentivised to do it. Economics is mainly about incentives and how these affect different people's behaviors. In that sense, one of the biggest problems with common goods is that there is an incentive misalignment and people are not incentivised to want to take care of things."

My argument back is that this is only the cost of running 1 full node, and we technically don't need everyone to run full node, we only need person to do so to make sure no data is completely lost.

        "text": "We provide over 100+ FREE crypto articles on our SubStack! :D (Link on our profile). This is not financial advice.\n\n \n\nWhen we discuss risks in crypto, we look at both risks from the perspective of token owners and risks from the protocol. By knowing their major sources of risk exposures, we can have a better picture of what the protocol will possibly be like in the long term, and a more thorough understanding of the whole crypto space. In this article, we will walk through a general framework and additional points to consider for financial risk analysis of stablecoins.\n\n**General classification of risk**\n\nBefore moving on to financial risk in details, let\u2019s recap on the general classification of risk that we are using. Under our analytical framework, risk is either systematic or idiosyncratic.\n\nSystematic risk are the ones that affect the whole market and cannot be well controlled by the protocol itself. This includes the market risk like price variations, failure of underlying blockchain layer and irregular user behaviour.\n\nMeanwhile, Idiosyncratic risk are the ones that are relevant to token and mechanism design, which can be controlled by the protocol to some extent and only directly affects the particular protocol itself.\n\n \n\nFig 1. General risk classification\n\nUnder our definition, financial risk is a type of idiosyncratic risk. It describes the risk of losing money in operation, which is predominantly determined by how the token is designed under the protocol. Financial risk for stablecoins comes from two main areas: cashflow and collaterals.\n\n**Financial risk from cashflow**\n\nWhen conducting risk analysis, cashflow is often one of the most direct and easily analyzable sources of risk. Changes in cashflow for the protocol over time gives information on how well the protocol is operating, and also its ability of pulling through a crisis. Meanwhile, cross comparison of cashflow figures and growth with other protocols can show which tokens in the market are in better financial standing and hence likely to be more sustainable.\n\nIn the long term, protocols with healthier cashflow conditions are more likely to gain investor confidence and attract more people in buying the tokens. This is extremely important for stablecoins, as their values are pegged to a previously specified amount with very minimal variation in monetary values. Investors make decisions to buy stablecoins based on how they plan to utilize the token, and also whether the token is reliable in the future.\n\nThe most common way to analyze financial risk from cashflow is to break down the incoming and outgoing cash over fixed time intervals, and compare their growth. Depending on how the protocol is designed, income and expense can be further classified into sub-categories based on where they come from, such as interest, trading and operating. Significant changes in the proportions of each category may indicate structural changes in the protocol\u2019s financial performance.\n\nAdvancing to a higher level of analysis, we can look at the key ratios calculated from cashflow data. These key ratios are created based on the data available for each protocol to compare income and expense data with the important token metrics such as price, transaction volume and market capitalization. Some of the possible key ratios that can be considered, but not limited to, are the following:\n\n* Percentage of each sub-category of income and expense\n* Ratio of cash inflow to outflow\n* Protocol net income to market capitalization\n* Protocol revenue income to market capitalization\n\nChanges in these ratios give information on how the protocol has been growing over time, which helps us to identify the stage of development and expected amount of variations in finance performance to better gauge their level of risk exposures. Given the complexity of token data and the fact that most protocols have only been created in the very recent years, we are still unable to form a clear cut-off for these ratios to distinguish between the different levels of risk. Nonetheless, these ratios can be used for comparison across time and market. Also, we will expect newer projects to have less stable financials, so the seemingly negative ratios in the early stage may not lead to the conclusion that protocol is facing high financial risk. But for projects that have existed for years with a stable pool of users, significant variations of key ratios may hint there could be changes in operation that changed the token holders\u2019 decisions and unhealthy cashflow.\n\n**Financial risk from collaterals**\n\nAnother significant source of financial risk of stablecoins comes from the collaterals. In the token market today, stablecoins maintain stability of value through collaterals or algorithmic mechanisms that balances the reserved assets. The types of collaterals used directly impacts buying decisions of the stablecoin, hence play an important role in determining the financial risk exposures. To analyze such risk, we will first look at how the stablecoin maintains its value, whether the reserve is made up of on-chain assets (other tokens), off-chain assets (cash and cash equivalents), a combination of the two, or through algorithms with no reserve or partial reserve.\n\n1. On-chain collateral  \nFor stablecoins collateralized with on-chain assets such as DAI and LUSD, the degree of transparency is often the highest as collateral data can be queried. We can study the composition of collaterals, including what are the assets making up the collateral pool, collaterization ratio of each type of asset and if there had been any significant changes in the structure of collateral pool in the past. For a stablecoin to be considered as having low financial risk exposure, the collateral pool should be relatively stable with no significant flux in proportion of each asset type. The collateralization ratio should also be set to a reasonable range, such that the value of collateral reserve can still sustain if there is a sudden decrease in collateralized asset prices, but also not to an overly high level that discourages investors from holding the token.\n2. Off-chain collateral  \nFor stablecoins collateralized with off-chain assets, such as cash, commercial paper, fiduciary deposits, secured loans, short term treasury bills, corporate bonds and other investments. For these tokens, financial risk exposure is lower when the proportion of cash is higher, as a reserve pool will have better ability to deal with unexpected situations that require high liquidity of assets. On the other end, tokens backed with assets that cannot be readily converted to cash may not stabilize to its pegged value when there is a sudden drop in collateral value. An important point to note here is that some protocols do not give a clear breakdown on the components of their fiat reserve. Instead of disclosing the proportion of cash, they report the proportion of cash and cash equivalents together to make the numbers more appealing to investors. Such lack of transparency will also lead to doubts and inconfidence, thereby increasing financial risk exposure.\n3. Non-collateralized  \nLastly, there is also a group of stablecoins that uses supply-changing algorithms to maintain its token price to a pegged value. Some of these tokens are partially backed by on-chain and off-chain reserves, while others are uncollateralized. For these algorithmic coins, we need to make specific analysis according to their structure of collateral. If they are completely unbacked, we can instead focus on the financial cashflow and ability of these tokens to maintain at a stable price.\n\n**Financial risk from token performance**\n\nIn addition to factors arising from token design and mechanism, token\u2019s performance is also a critical factor of financial risk. These include the ability of the stablecoin pegging to a specific monetary value, market dominance and applied uses that directly affect token\u2019s transaction activities and income.\n\nLow price volatility indicates that the token is well-backed by collaterals or supply is under control by algorithms, hence has better ability to store and maintain monetary value. This will attract more people to hold the stablecoin and more platforms to utilise it. We can also consider indicators like market dominance, and overall ranking of the stablecoin in the whole token market. Tokens with better rankings are likely to have more investors and transaction volume, which bring a stable income stream and enhances the protocol\u2019s resilience against financial risk.\n\nC**onclusion**\n\nJust like the case for many other financial assets, risk analysis for stablecoins is a complex process with no clear distinctions or standards, and we may face many difficulties in deducing the level of risk present. But going from the main sources of risk from financial performance, collaterals and token performance, we can get a general picture of the financial risk exposures of a protocol. Due to the difference in design and mechanism of the various protocols, a thorough risk analysis needs to cover multiple aspects and may require analysts to create new metrics specifically applicable to the protocol.\n\nSome additional points to consider here include the time frame of data used, as financial risk is a long term concept that is hard to predict if there are unexpected changes in token design after governance voting or new regulation being implemented. Some metrics may also have double-sided impact on financial risk. For example, over-collateralization gives a stable cash reserve to sustain through a financial shock, but also leads to large amounts of funds unused which may hinder token\u2019s scalability in the long term. Thus, we need to be aware of these limitations, understand the interactions between different types of risks and make careful judgements when determining the level of risk exposures."

If that's true, how will the base layer scale to 1,000TPS if there will only be 1 execution shard? Won't it process the same number of transactions even if data shards are introduced? Thanks everyone.\n\nNote: I thought I remember someone (possibly Vitalik) stating that the base layer will scale to 1,000 TPS (L2s scaling up to 100,000TPS) during a podcast. Maybe I'm misremembering, but I could've sworn that was the case."

There are no good outcomes here, which is why it is critical that we do not end up in such a situation.\n\nWE have now the time to make client diversity healthy!!\n\nChange client or make a lot of noise for your stake provider to change client, because if you don't and there is a bug on prysm....\n\nI SAY FUCK YOUR MONEY\/STAKE let all be slash AF.

There is wrappers around veCRV that can be traded. Like cvxCRV, but still, nothing like the original governance token.\n\nAssuming it's favoring staking over non-staking, I think the ve model decreases the price of the token due to the liquidity premium (you need to lock to get the \"correct\" total return). So, not all token holders are treated the same. It certainly favours those who can afford the time lock.\n\nIt encourages the aggregation of vote power to a select few entities (e.g. votemak, redacted, etc) which hurts self sovereignty.\n\nVoting system based on such tokenomics optimizes voting on pools that token holders expect to generate most fees (since their fee stream is generated only from these pools). \n\nIt is good since it allows to allocate token emission resources to support pools that are really used.\n\nBut here is a question that remains to be answered - could such mechanism design be applied to the project you want it to apply? Nobody knows.\n\nlet's use Yearn as a example, a DAO with a variety of products that generate income but has a lot of native tokens in the Treasury. \n\nSome key differences are worth exploring... Opening up voting rights to all. No distributing of the Governance Tokens across various products.\n\nwhat else am i missing? both positive and negative?"

The questions revolved around two main topics: the Golem ecosystem, and the future of the Golem Network team.\n\n**The Golem Ecosystem**\n\nMany people have been asking what can be hosted on Golem right now, what can be filtered, and what\u2019s the most profitable way to be a host. These questions are very technical, and may vary a lot depending on what is available; so, we will try to make this as simple as possible.\n\nIn regard to what will be able to be hosted in the future, we are putting incoming\/outgoing network communications in the pipeline, as well as unstoppable services (services that don\u2019t require a requester to be online 24\/7), and some type of trust management to help facilitate these two functions. One very exciting piece of information that was announced was that ARM support is coming this year.\n\nOnce [ARM support](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GolemProject\/comments\/ryemit\/comment\/hsdbqlb\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) comes along, recommended builds may change. Currently, any build with [more than 2 cores\/threads](https:\/\/stats.golem.network\/) is sufficient to run on Golem, but we do not recommend buying new computers\/servers solely to host on Golem. At one point, [LIFE@Golem](https:\/\/blog.golemproject.net\/deep-dive-into-our-collaboration-with-allchemy\/) would only allow for 24 cores or more to run their programs, and a number of users found this to be very profitable for them; when LIFE@Golem started analyzing their data, many of these high-core computers were turned off, as they likely used more electricity than your average computer would.\n\nCurrently, requestors can rent computer power and filter based on processor type (e.g. Intel\/AMD), disk-space, RAM, cores\/threads, and prices. If requestors don\u2019t find your internet speed or compute power adequate, then they can filter a specific provider out of their criteria, so the provider won\u2019t receive a request to get paid for computing power.\n\n**The Future of the Golem Network**\n\nWe unofficially announced that some [SWAG](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GolemProject\/comments\/ryemit\/comment\/hsdbqlb\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) would be coming out, in Q1 or Q2, for all the people who obtained a POAP from the [5-year anniversary of Golem](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GolemProject\/comments\/qui9dr\/golem_5_year_anniversary_gettogether_is_happening\/)! On top of that, we got to share our favorite parts of the future of Golem. We discussed dApps on Golem, CPU\/GPU tasks on Thorg, and DeFi.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThat\u2019s all for now, we would like to thank our community for asking many challenging questions, and firing interesting discussions about the future ahead of us.\n\nHere are some resources for you to learn more and keep up with the Golem Project.\n\nWebsite: [http:\/\/golem.network\/](http:\/\/golem.network\/)\n\nTwitter: [https:\/\/twitter.com\/golemproject](https:\/\/twitter.com\/golemproject)\n\nDiscord Chat: [http:\/\/chat.golem.network\/](http:\/\/chat.golem.network\/)\n\nFacebook: [https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/golemproject\/](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/golemproject\/)\n\nYoutube [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCl3fxgrSML2sL3UYZrynbMg](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCl3fxgrSML2sL3UYZrynbMg)\n\nGithub: [https:\/\/github.com\/golemfactory](https:\/\/github.com\/golemfactory)\n\nHandbook: [https:\/\/handbook.golem.network\/](https:\/\/handbook.golem.network\/)"

Using an analogy that prysm users are alike to alcoholics that do not care about anyone but themselves. Which I think only accomplishes painting prysm users as bad guys and dividing the community, which isn't helpful. I'm not criticism superphiz for phrasing it that way, and I highly doubt he is trying to intentionally paint prysm users as bad, it's just how I take the analogy he used. \n  \nEvery reason I hear is \"Prysm has a supermajority, this is unhealthy for the network, there are a ton of known bugs when a client has a supermajority that will likely prevent the merge. prysm should take ownership of this issue\"  \n  \nI believe having specific details is more convincing than blindly trusting someone's word that something is unhealthy. It takes time, but people really do listen to convincing arguments based on reason and evidence. So that's why I'm asking for an expansion and specifics in what's being said, it will help both sides.\n  \nAdditional question... if client diversity is critical to eth2, why wasn't it built into the clients and protocol? We already know people are less reliable than computers, so I feel if client diversity was important the devs would've coded it in. Therefore, it's either not important or the PoS devs had a horrible oversight in not including client diversity at the protocol level.   \n  \nAnd would it not make more sense for superphiz to write an EIP to have client diversity built into the protocol layer? I know I've seen some discussion of deducting eth from those accounts who run majority clients. If approved, that seems like it would be the end-all to this topic."

This makes me questioning about the censorship risk of stable tokens issued by centralized entities.\n\nUSDC by Circle, BUSD\/USDP by Paxos, WBTC by BitGo, etc. Do these tokens can be freezed by the issuers?\n\nHow about partially-usdc-backed stablecoins issued by DAOs like DAI by MakerDAO and FRAX by FraxDAO? What will happen if Circle freezes USDC held by those DAOs?\n\nWhich stabletoken is truly decentralized? Algorithmic stablecoin on other chain like UST by Terra and cUSD by Celo may have unreliable collateral. sUSD by Synthetix is also collateralized by SNX which may has similar reliability to Terra and Celo.\n\nSo, does the truly decentralized stablecoin must only use ETH as collateral? If that's so, then so far as I know, the choice is RAI by Reflexer and LUSD by Liquity. RAI is unpegged while LUSD is pegged to USD. I might just pick both 50\/50 as my stable holdings, but RAI is issued by Reflexer Labs which is based in the US, is that a risk?\n\nTo be clear, I'm not trying to shill any token\/protocol here. I want to find a stablecoin which is the most decentralized stablecoin available rn bc currently I hold tens percent of multiple stablecoins. Can't imagine if those funds are frozen"

(which it was initially designed to be). Now, this concept has me thinking a lot about Ethereum and it's path to becoming the new future currency of the world. Has Ethereum now screwed itself by becoming a deflationary asset? I feel like more and more people are treating Ethereum like silver, as if its Bitcoin's (the internets gold) little brother. And yes, I know that Ethereum is nothing like Bitcoin. Ethereum has smart contracts, its PoS, and has a lot more going for itself that Bitcoins dinosaur tech. Look, I can 100% see Ethereum being massively successful within its own ecosystem. It really is the currency of every dApp built on the Ethereum blockchain, BUT. Will someone ever really spend their precious Ethereum on a car? It just sounds stupid to do so. Of course it's just a matter of time and adoption before crypto-assets become more stable. But that doesn't remove Ethereum's deflationary properties. I'm no blockchain expert, but doesn't Ethereum get more deflationary the more its used? I am genuinely curious about any thoughts other people have on this. The only type of currencies I see becoming the worlds 1 currency is an inflationary one. Imagine if the dollar became inflationary.."

I have some rudimentary understanding of crypto-currencies and haven't explored DeFi as much yet. Here are some thigs i would like to highlight:\n\n1. **Setting up context:** What is DeFi and how it differs from traditional finance? Baseline information to make the reader understand how the authority is taken away from centralised institutions.\n2. **Future Possibilities:** How will it change the current landscape of financial services, and what new concepts could come out of this?\n3. **Is it really \"Decentralised\" (as of today)?**: With centralised exchanges ruling the trade of cryptocurrencies that are required for using these platforms, and existing institutions (both state and private) trying to jump on the bandwagon and \"re-centralise\" cryptocurrencies and DeFi as a whole... is DeFi as we know it gonna end up being \"truly decentralised\"?\n4. **Future scalibility and viability**: Economically, Environmentally, and Socially (in terms of accessibility and adoption)\n\nNow within this structure, i would like to get sources of information that are actually reliable and not just marketing fluff. Send away as much information as you can towards these concepts and please feel free to provide further suggetions on what i can add\/improve\/cover in a more concrete manner. \n\nAlso let me know what terminologies & core concepts i must acquaint myself with when it comes to all this.\n\nThanks"

I\u2019m a long term holder and see Ethereum just as any other technology asset.\n\nI have roughly 6 figures of capital that I'm ready to add into a long term position in ETH the technology so I guess my main question is, am I better off just purchasing now, then storing it on the ledger (Paying the cheaper network fees today) and for future purchases using DCA, using another L2 wallet as the L1 Gas fees become higher. **In the future will the gas fees outweigh the capital I'm trying to withdraw? (Or transfer to become staked)**\n\n**My ideal outcome would be that I could just buy ETH each month and have it securely stored offline in the hardware wallet for the long term. And then, someday into the future, have the ability to easily, securely, and as economically viable as possible withdraw\/access the tokens.**\n\nHowever, I\u2019ve come to understand that the gas fees for Ethereum layer 1 will gradually get more and more expensive as demand increases\/scales so I\u2019ve been looking into layer 2 wallets and storage solutions but I\u2019m very cautious\/ weary. I understand that computation is done off chain then posted to L1 for the green check. **If for example, layer 2 services like Hedera go offline for maintenance\/hack does that effect withdrawals\/transfers from the wallet? Also wondering if it\u2019s possible to transfer funds from one L2 wallet to another at this stage? (transfer seed phrase into another wallet to gain access to funds)**\n\nI\u2019m using 2 ledgers (A nano X and S) and a Cyrptosteel stored securely in a protected environment. None of the tech has been \u201cSetup\u201d as of yet as I am still working out the details. If I was going to run Metamask or ledger live I\u2019d use another computer solely for crypto and\/or a \u201cLive\u201d OS running from an external drive combined with a VPN.\n\nThe Ledger and Cryptosteel were purchased using fake information and paid for via crypto\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated. I\u2019m still very early on my thesis for Ethereum as a technology but would like to (Just with any other asset) hold onto it in the most secure way possible for the long term and have the ability to deposit\/withdraw in the future without the Gas fees eating up too much of my capital.\n\nRegards,\n\nSome dude on Reddit."

        "text": "We provide over 100+ FREE crypto articles on our SubStack! :D (Link on our profile). This is not financial advice.\n\n  \n\n**TLDR**:\n\nIn short, the governance token is a step forward in the decentralisation of voting rights led by DeFi. With Governance tokens, if they only have governance functions, have no intrinsic value in themselves, but they are related to the incentives of each different protocol, so they carry other values. Their value can be seen in three main incentives: Liquidity Mining, Lending, and Staking, along with a combination of protocol-specific incentives. That is why we often see relatively valuations like PE and PS. However, governance tokens still have certain risks which affect the main purpose for which they are formed.\n\n# General Conclusion\n\nGovernance tokens emerged thanks to the birth of famous DeFi projects such as MakerDAO, Compound, Aave, Uniswap, etc., which have seen growth in marketcap skyrocket since DeFi Summer 2020.\n\nIn today's article, we will discuss what governance tokens are, how they impact the DeFi space, and why they are valuable.\n\n# What Is A Governance Token?\n\n>A governance token is a type of token that grants voting rights to their owners in a particular protocol.\n\nThere are currently two ways to calculate the power of voting for governance tokens: token-weighted voting (almost protocols) and time-weighted voting (e.g. Curve).\n\nVoting power is weighted according to the number of tokens, which means that the more governance tokens a holer holds, the more decision-making weight they have on an issue. While time-weighted voting rights give more rights to those who lock the governance token for longer.\n\n## Off-Chain Governance\n\nIn off-chain governance, network participants communicate outside of the network. These mechanisms can be used to grant token holders informal voting rights. Votes can signal the community to download the code change, but **votes do not automatically trigger the change**. If a minority disagrees, they can choose not to download the code update. This will result in two separate networks (hard fork).\n\n## On-Chain Governance\n\nWith on-chain governance, **code changes are done automatically once voting is complete**. Similar to off-chain governance, a minority can choose a minority group can choose to create a hard fork with the new changes.\n\nThe main difference between the two governances is in the way in which participants choose to participate. The on-chain governance allows the code change to occur by majority vote, while the off-chain governance requires participants to download the code change.\n\n>As an open-source network, each scenario presents an opportunity for the minority to create a network that works for them.\n\nFor example, we have seen many forked platforms like Sushiswap from Uniswap, Swerve from Curve or Mirror from Synthetix. Basically, these fork platforms either compete directly with the original platform (Swerve) or go in a new direction compared to the original platform (SushiSwap, Mirror).\n\nGovernance tokens allow holders to vote for changes in the network to which they belong. Usually, the number of tokens a person holds is proportional to the power of votes they have.\n\n# Governance Token Impact On DeFi\n\nFor many in the crypto space, governance tokens are a key function of the DeFi protocol that enables decentralised voting. This approach is consistent with the financial decentralisation that the system hopes to achieve.\n\nThe principles of DeFi focus on financial democracy:\n\n* The ability for all users to participate; and\n* Have a voice in a monetary system that works in favor of the majority.\n\nLooking back in history, we have seen a change in governance in protocols like MakerDAO and Synthetix. In March 2020 MakerDAO completed its transition to complete community governance. In the course of 2020 Synthetix launched several DAOs, with each DAO managing separate parts of the protocol created by the main developers.\n\n>This could be an indication of where DeFi is headed."

        "text": "Hello \/r\/Ethereum,\n\nThis is going to be the first in hopefully a long line of informational posts about the Ethereum ecosystem. I\u2019m not planning much rhyme or reason to what I cover, but with each post I hope to give a general introduction to the topic at hand and provide a springboard from which a reader can begin additional research. I want to be relatively unbiased in my research and I\u2019ll strive for correctness, but if you see something glaringly wrong please call it out so I can correct the record. The overall goal is not to do an exhaustive \u201cdeep dive\u201d into a specific topic but rather to provide an introductory overview so that the reader is equipped to do additional research if they choose. \n\nSo let\u2019s get into the first topic: \n\n**High-level L2 Ecosystem Overview**\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard about \u201cL2\u201d by now; it\u2019s Ethereum\u2019s solution to the blockchain trilemma. Rather than try to do everything on mainnet, new cryptography concepts have enabled the off-loading of transaction execution to secondary networks called rollups. These secondary networks will be able to \u201cinherit\u201d the security of Ethereum mainnet while bundling thousands of transactions together for drastic fee savings.\n\nFor more on the details and theory behind rollups, check out Polynya\u2019s blog: https:\/\/polynya.medium.com\/ \n\nBut enough about theory- what rollups exist today? What differentiates them? What risks are there? \n\nFirst, some useful resources:\n\nhttps:\/\/l2fees.info\/ - A simple overview of what some common actions cost on several rollups compared to Ethereum mainnet\n\nhttps:\/\/l2beat.com\/ - An incredibly useful site aggregating all sorts of up-to-date information about layer-2s\n\nhttps:\/\/defillama.com\/chains \u2013 Statistics aggregator for DeFi. Great for comparing TVL between chains and rollups.\n\n[ethl2s.com](https:\/\/mirror.xyz\/ethmaxitard.eth\/iyCAlOexgQKOvoSAAk4utYGEdnESOKb5HstM2_LaqL4) -  Quick reference for all sorts of L2 information including fiat onramps, bridges, wallets, and apps. \n\nNow, the major players in the rollup space:\n\n* [Arbitrum](https:\/\/portal.arbitrum.one\/) \u2013 The largest rollup by TVL and by number of deployed dApps. Arbitrum uses fraud proofs for security, and usage is very similar to mainnet. Currently centralized and does have admin keys during beta. Fees are a few dollars.\n* [StarkWare](https:\/\/starkware.co\/) \u2013 Creators of StarkNet and StarkEx. StarkNet is their general-purpose rollup which is currently in mainnet alpha and only has \u201ctest\u201d apps right now. StarkEx is the rollup tech powering dYdX, ImmutableX, DeversiFi, and Sorare. Uses validity proofs for security, and each StarkEx app has different security attributes. StarkEx apps have over a billion dollars in combined TVL, easily the 2nd largest rollup by that measurement.\n* [Optimism](https:\/\/gateway.optimism.io\/) \u2013 Arbitrum\u2019s main fraud proof competitor. Usage is again very similar to mainnet and has a decent number of deployed apps. Currently centralized with admin keys and the fraud proofs are not yet operational. Has been un-whitelisted since December 2021, and fees are a bit lower than Arbitrum\u2019s. \n* [Loopring](https:\/\/loopring.io\/#\/) \u2013 Everyone has probably heard of LRC by now, but you might not know that it was the first operational validity proof rollup! LRC has been operational for well over a year now and recently launched their L2 smart wallet app. They\u2019re one of the few rollups with a token right now. Loopring has fairly good security, their main flaw is that there is no delay on code updates; they do have an operational \u201cescape hatch\u201d however. Fees are generally under $1 for transfers. \n* [Metis Andromeda](https:\/\/www.metis.io\/ecosystem-partners\/) \u2013 A fork of Optimism, Metis has set out to be a home for DAOs so that they can more seamlessly cooperate with each other and with the broader digital economy. They currently share all of the drawbacks of Optimism, although there is a METIS token available. \n* [Boba Network](https:\/\/boba.network\/ecosystem\/) \u2013 Another optimistic rollup made with forked code from Optimism, Boba is built by the Enya team at the OMG foundation. They share the same vulnerabilities as the other Optimism forks, and like Metis they do have a token (BOBA). It\u2019s still relatively early days for Boba, and it remains to be seen how well they stack up against competitors since they\u2019re also aiming to be a general-purpose L2. \n* [ZKSwap](https:\/\/www.zks.org\/) \u2013 Similar to Loopring, ZKSwap is designed to be a validity-proof-based L2 DEX with transfers and an NFT marketplace. There are subtle differences in the tech design of ZKSwap vs. Loopring which I won\u2019t get into here. ZKSwap does have an 8-day delay on updates and an operational escape hatch function, and it also has a token (ZKS). Edit: As the comments point out, ZKSwap is a direct fork of zkSync. \n* [zkSync](https:\/\/zksync.io\/) \u2013 Created by Matter Labs, zkSync is aiming to be a major player in the zkEVM space. Their current product \u201czkSync 1.0\u201d is available today with transfers\/trades and limited NFT functionality, but 2.0 is in testnet which is aiming to have full EVM compatibility. ZkSync is arguably one of the safest rollups currently with a 14-day delay on code updates and an operational escape hatch should the operator go down. There is currently no token, although zkSync has confirmed that they intend to move to community governance in the future. Fees are generally under $1 for transfers. \n* [Aztec](https:\/\/zk.money\/) \u2013 Also known as zk.money, Aztec is the only operational rollup aiming to be a privacy network. Currently zk.money 1.0 is live and available for \u201cshielding\u201d transactions, and they plan to launch 2.0 in 2022 along with \u201cdecentralization\u201d. If they\u2019re able to achieve EVM compatibility, you could essentially have monero-like privacy while using Ethereum-based assets and apps. They currently have some of the strongest rollup security with zk.money 1.0, although it is limited to simple payments. \n* [Polygon](https:\/\/polygon.technology\/get-started\/) \u2013 Everybody knows about the MATIC sidechain (commit-chain?) but you might not know that Polygon is also a tech leader in the zk-rollup space. They\u2019ve acquired several cutting-edge teams and are developing several projects such as Miden, Nightfall, Zero, and Hermez. Their operational zk rollup product is Hermez, which only performs simple payments at the moment and has some compromises in terms of security. It\u2019s unclear whether the MATIC token will have a role to play in the rollup economy, but Polygon itself is likely to be around for a long time as they\u2019ve developed important tech in the space.\n\nHopefully I\u2019ve given each major rollup a fair summary. I highly recommend reading the information on l2beat.com to understand where each rollup stands in terms of adoption and security. If you\u2019d like to try one out, evaluate your own security needs relative to the value of your investment, and proceed accordingly. If you find an ecosystem you enjoy, pay close attention to it! New things are happening nearly every day in this space and staying abreast of all the updates is like drinking from a firehose. \n\nIf you have questions, comments, or concerns please leave a comment and I\u2019ll be happy to expand on what I\u2019ve written."

I can create a token on both ETH and BSC and they make a bridge. and record in coinmarketcap every token contract adresss for all my tokens on all those EVM compatible chain, achieving the same result.  \n\n\nThanks."

I am in this because I have heard a ton of ways ppl are making lots of money, just as much loosing too, even more so. I invested about $500 into a Metamask account and for the next couple weeks I was looking for the perfect project to flip for profit. Im in this for the short game. I don\u2019t really care about the community or perks of owning, just buy and sell for a profit. I bought into this one project. I was like $260 and $330 with gas fees. The activity seemed good and the art was cool too. I then almost instantly go to sell it. I see what others are selling for a decide a price. Then a $200 fee just for selling? How am I supposed to turn a profit with the gas fees being higher than what I\u2019m selling for?"

This is Justin Maher, a well known scammer in the crypto\/defi world specifically erc20 making their way to bnb. Along with Russ Davis, they launch projects they then send out as picks. They pretend not to know developers, but have doxxed them and vouch. They have tokenomiks with \"eth reflections\" usually have a dApp on their website, to connect your wallet and claim. This is a great way for them to make tons of money quickly themselves. This is partially the main reason why you'll see the uniswap router dump tons of amounts of eth in their projects also. The excuse when the dump\/rugs happen is usually \"the devs ran off\" Or \"lost the keys.\" Then they move on to a new project, Don't be fooled by their locked liquidity tactics either because they use \"presale\" to stock up on coins as well as other methods like sniping their own project. Don't be fooled by a large quantity of holders, they airdrop thousands of people to fluff numbers and use tons of bots for telegram subscribers. They can afford to do anything as they've scammed for millions of dollars. They've launched many different projects, from ACCEL, Ascend token, Shunav1,Shuna v2, levelup, weGrow, boombabyio, to matrix samurai, peeps, Bezoge, Arena, HODL, fkemax, viceX and many many others. Serenity is coming up, another scam. The owner, justin Maher has been served by the sec, resigned from northwestern mutual as an financial advisor, and caused all of Ethereummax's issues being the founder that took part in the launch and obtained hundreds of trillions of tokens at that time. I really want to help make this world a better place and stop people like this from destroying the industry. They have many moderators they pay in tokens that will pretend they're fans of these projects, even after they rug. I'm shocked they never get upset. Justin Maher is a master manipulator and I have fell for his lies many times, but Accel was the last lie I'll fall for. I've learned my lesson in the erc20 world thanks to people like Justin Maher and Russ Davis (inRussWetrust crypto group on facebook), I quickly learned in Russ we don't trust... Russ and justin are brother in laws that act like they don't work together, but the blockchain and all wallets tell us a different story. Lets help clean up the defi space and rid the world of scammers like this. Any comments defending this post, are those moderators\nin their crypto groups that they've sent to defend them, by posting a link in telegram and telling everyone to please defend them. Especially people that are part of this charade.[here\u2019s his revoked license ](https:\/\/brokercheck.finra.org\/individual\/summary\/5504995)\n\nUpdate as per private messages and comments : Defi Angels, another group managed by (Taylor Paige- owner, Kay- admin, Shiney- admin, Jess Wills, Michael Garcia, few more to name) are also big scammers in the defi space with price manipulation. They receive tons of coins from projects and dump on projects. They dumped on Shuna v1, V2 and many others. These people must be stopped. As per pressed chat I saw a message stating Taylor Paige has a big payroll, so moderators of his and memebers of his community are paid to pretend they don\u2019t know and stay quiet."

In the past two weeks, multiple skills such woodcutting + firemaking, mining + smithing, fishing + cooking, and attack were implemented, and you can now fight monsters to collect gold, and even fight other players. If another player kills you, they take all your gold, and if you kill another player you get all of their gold!\n\nThere are currently four prize pools to compete in each week, for a total of 1,680 xDai (and growing!) to be won by the top players of each prize pool  \nPrize Pool #1 (720 xDai): Top 7 players with the most XP gained this week  \nPrize Pool #2 (320 xDai): Top 4 players with the most gold coins  \nPrize Pool #3 (320 xDai): Top 4 players with the most referrals  \nPrize Pool #4 (320 xDai): Top 4 players with the highest total levels\n\nLast week, NFTs were introduced, as well as the Party Room! Party Room tickets are NFTs that can be redeemed for 8 xDai each, and can be exchanged for membership. Membership grants you special content, maps, and customization. Cosmetic NFTs are on the roadmap soon as well...\n\nThe Party Room is an event that occurs every hour. To get into the Party Room, you can stake 1 Party Room Ticket. Then you compete in three rounds, lasting 60 seconds each, in which you can get a share of all Party Room Tickets and gold. This opens up the opportunity for you to win xDai every hour! The more players that play, the bigger the prize pool...\n\nLooking forward to week 7!"

These three actions were within a few minutes timespan.\n\nThe airdrop cost me like $20. The NFT listing cost me $55 or such. Then I had to perform one more action I don\u2019t remember what was for, but this cost $20 roughly. Finally, to deposit for staking costs $160 in gas. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to spend that much so I kept checking during the day yesterday and also right now when gas is usually cheap. However it\u2019s still close to $150.\n\nDoes gas price change depending on what action you want to perform? Since staking is sooo much more expensive than for example claiming my airdrop"

I\u2019m US-based.\n\nHere\u2019s my current situation:\nI\u2019ve been holding 1\/3 of my ETH (and adding to my position) in my Nexo wallet for years now. I hold enough Nexo tokens to earn ETH interest at a premium rate of 6% APY, in fixed monthly terms. The rest is held in my ledger.\n\nAs we approach the merge, I\u2019m thinking about how to stake the other 2\/3 of my ETH which is just sitting pretty right now. Ideally I\u2019d like to stake this amount rather than pool it all in a centralized wallet.\n\nMy staking concerns are mostly around inefficient taxes and derivative token risk.\n\nWith Lido and Rocketpool, a derivative token is used while you stake with them. It\u2019s not actual ETH and you need to trust the contract supporting it. The exchange also concerns me because I\u2019ll need to realize years of gains\u2026 I understand that the token appreciation will bake in the staking gains, but I\u2019d rather pay taxes on incremental gains (if I choose to sell them).\n\nPersonally, I\u2019d rather keep pure ETH and hope to stake it non-custodially. Will L2 or side-chain staking become an option after the merge?\n\nThank you for your ideas and kindness."

So i called my bank and they said that there is no issue on their end. After this i tried to use a different card but it did the same thing for both wallets and this is 2 days after initially trying. So i finally got crypto.com and went to verify my ID  and that takes a day but i tried to buy eth anyway and it wouldn't let me im assuming it's because my ID is not verified yet but the other wallet incidents are beyond me"

        "text": "We provide over 100+ FREE crypto articles on our SubStack! :D (Link on our profile). This is not financial advice.\n\n \n\n**TLDR**:\n\nTokens are not a magic pill that will solve all issues. **Know your competitive advantage of using a token** and exploit all the advantages that tokens can bring to your ecosystem. It is more than just a simple store of value \u2014 not every token is bitcoin.\n\n# General Conclusion\n\nIn this episode, we interview Arthur Cheong, a DeFi investor. He's on Twitter as Arthur\\_0x. From the perspective of an investor, who invests in tokens and token projects, we uncover what makes a good token economics so that investors are interested in investing in that. He also shared his top 3 projects with good token economics, opinions on yield farming and advise when designing tokens.\n\n# 1. What makes a good token?\n\nNumber 1 factor is that there must be **concrete value accrual or value capture**. What does it mean? Tokens have something that is worthy for you to invest. The most popular token is Bitcoin. Bitcoin is investable because you can think of it as digital gold. It is a store of value because people believe that there is a scarcity in supply and (hence) value. The value did pretty well over the last 10 years and also has shown to be the most reliable token. So bitcoin is investable because it is a good store of value over the medium to long term.\n\n**Store of value** comes from a very **huge network effect**. If you are like Litecoin or other smaller crypto, you will struggle to be a good store of value because money has a very huge network effect. It's just like USD. They have huge network effect. When you are using it, you are less likely to use other smaller currencies as your day to day transaction, be it your international commerce, and also financial activities. Most are denominated in USD. It is the same for crypto.\n\nBeyond money, the other investable tokens are some tokens that give you some sort of value capture, like some **claim to the cash flow**, either through a direct reward distribution or have some sort of buyback and burn mechanism.\n\nThese are the one that make it a good token.\n\n# 2. Summary of Good Token Economics\n\n(1) it is able to **tokenise the economic value accrued by the network** so that it can be distributed to the users and the community. Because at the end of the day, one of the principle is that decetralisation also means equality or distribution of power to the community and users of the community.\n\n(2) there has to be **very clear value accrual or value capture**. Either within the ecosystem or compared to alternatives or options outside the ecosystem and off-chain solutions.\n\n(3) token is not just a one-off asset or thing to have one objective, which is probably a store of value. But a **token has a lot of other use cases** that needs to be tapped on like a way to bootstrap the ecosystem. It's **more than just one objective** that the token serves, but it has a lot more secondary and tertiary objectives that a token has to serve. To maximise the usage of the token, to maximise the existence of tokens in the ecosystem.\n\n# 3. If you can have one advice that you can give to token designers or economic designers, what would you give?\n\nTo summarise, that would be one to **know your competitive advantage of using a token** as opposed to the traditional market where no tokens are being used because that is where the strength of tokenisation lies.\n\nThe second is to **use tokens to its utmost advantage**, to explore and leverage all the benefits that tokens can bring. It can be incentivising, reputation building, etc.\n\nAnd lastly is absolutely **find product market fit.** Tokens are not a magic pill. It\u2019s not Jack and the Beanstalk, when you have the pill or the beans and you can grow a beautiful solution to eradicate you from poverty. Tokens are really just a means to an end. Tokens are not an end to itself. Tokens can only help to accelerate growth if there is something about growing. That means, this product has good product market fit, that is much better than the alternatives in the space. People are willing to use it, to test it, to try it."

First of all, I am very new to this area so please consider me as a super noob.  \n\n\nSince all the smart contracts are publicly available to anyone, how is it possible to send a signed data by user X. For example, I want to create a smart contract which can be transact by any user (User X). The amount of the required ETH should be determined by my own web service but the transaction will be executed by user x. The smart contract will not hold data or do any check regarding the ETH amount. But within the smart contract I need to validate that the sent data is not edited by the user x. Does anyone  know how I can achieve this scenario?  \n\n\nSo imagine there is a marketplace with users can set their own ETH amount. Once a buyers wants to buy the regarding object, a transaction data (with the required ETH amount) will be generated by my web service. This generated data will be sent to the smart contract with the required ETH amount. After it's validated, the transaction should pass. \n\nThanks in advance!"

By November, 1 million ETH were burned. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum doesn\u2019t have a limited supply, but it does have an annual maximum supply of 18 million ETH.\n\n[https:\/\/youtu.be\/EvgR4aACp5A](https:\/\/youtu.be\/EvgR4aACp5A)"

Like the romans who would nail a few bodies to some crosses at the entrance of the city as a warning to the rest that **they better toe the line**.\n\nWell, now is **our chance** to make an example of a federal politician.  Namely, California congressman **Brad Sherman** for the United State house of representatives is up for re-election.  The primary election is happening right now.  His primary opponent, **Aarika Rhodes** is making broad headway against him as I write this.  Her funding is increasing, her operations on the ground are swelling, and she has a **real chance to unseat Mr. Sherman in the primary**.  Ms. Rhodes is an elementary school science teacher and has much sympathy for the crypto movement, and isn't afraid to voice her support.  Now is **OUR chance** to make an example to the political establishment.  If we can **rally around Ms. Rhodes with financial support** and otherwise, we have a real chance of unseating Mr. Sherman, and demonstrating to the world of politics that it is time to respect this movement rather than disparage it.\n\nHere is a **recent bankless** [episode](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2eHSWyOdszU) that includes an interview with Ms. Rhodes.\n\nHere is a [link](https:\/\/secure.actblue.com\/donate\/aarika-for-congress) to make a donation to her campaign.  She accepts USD, BTC, and BCH.  Doesn't accept ETH yet, but that may just be an oversight, as she is still coming up to speed on the broader aspects of crypto and Web 3.\n\nYou can make a difference.  We can make a difference.  Especially if we work collectively on good causes such as these."

        "text": " We provide over 100+ FREE crypto articles on our SubStack! :D (Link on our profile). This is not financial advice.  \n **TLDR**:Asset management is a large market sector in traditional finance with revenue generating $4.2B per year. This is an opportunity for non-crypto native users to tap into the growing DeFi opportunity, and for the DeFi projects to move in this direction or collaborate with existing partners.In this article, we have shown how five asset managers work. These managers are basically quite similar in operation and token use case. However, each strategy in each protocol is different, leading to different rates of return. \n\n# General Conclusion\n\nIn the traditional financial market, you may be quite familiar with the \"index baskets\" such as S&P500, Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), etc. These index baskets each include a lot of financial assets. Products designed by leading experts, helping you diversify your portfolio risk and achieve investment performance in the simplest way.In this article we will compare 5 blockchain-based asset managers by their goals, how they work, and what is the use case of their tokens.\n\n# Yearn Finance\n\nyEarn Finance is a liquidity aggregator, running on the Ethereum blockchain for lending platforms. yEarn Finance helps users achieve the highest profit during smart contract interactions.What is the problem that yEarn Finance sets out to solve?Liquidity mining programmes like Compound or Aave are places that allow LPs (liquidity providers) to provide liquidity and earn profits.Currently, more and more similar protocols are appearing, with flexible forms of change. The problem is: how can LPs maximise their profits? It is very difficult to switch between protocols continuously.yEarn Finance was born to solve this problem. It makes it easy for users to optimise profits with algorithms to compare, choose the place with the highest revenue, save research time and switch between parties.yEarn uses the following protocols for aggregation: Compound, dY\/dX, Aave, Curve, and supports the following stablecoins $DAI, $USDC, $USDT, $TUSD, $sUSD, and more.\n\n# Dhedge\n\ndHedge is a decentralised asset management protocol built on Ethereum. dHedge allows anyone to create their own investment fund on Ethereum or invest in funds managed by others in a completely non-custodial way using Synthetics Assets. dHedge brings decentralised, permissionless services to traditional wealth management services.\n\n# Harvest Finance\n\nHarvest Finance is an automated yield farming protocol that allows profit sharing between 'hard worker' and 'farmer'.Harvest Finance automatically collects the highest returns from DeFi protocols and optimises the profits received using the latest farming techniques.\n\n# Indexed Finance\n\nIndexed Finance is a project focused on developing passive portfolio management strategies for the Ethereum network.Indexed Finance is managed by $NDX governance token holders, which are used to vote on protocol update proposals and high-level index management, such as defining market sectors and creating new management strategies for investors.\n\n# Vesper Finance\n\nVesper provides a platform for DeFi products that are easily accessible to users. Vesper DeFi products make it easy for users to achieve financial goals in the crypto space.Vesper Products: At launch, Vesper offered many profitable \u201cGrow Pools\u201d that allow users to increase profits from holding coins like BTC, ETH, VSP, DAI, USDC. Vesper Grow Pools represent the first product on the Vesper platform. Further products will be provided to users in the near future.Basically, it's like Yearn.finance (YFI). Vesper helps users maximise profits by automatically sending their funds to high-interest protocols: Compound, AAVE, Curve, Uniswap, etc."

Ethereum-based tokens can represent the value and service, and innovative companies use these tokens as internal currencies to buy, sell, and trade within the ecosystem.\n\nNow that Ethereum supports token development, its community also sets some standards to ensure that tokens created on Ethereum are compostable with various existing ecosystems and satisfy specific user requirements.

Not your keys, not your crypto, right?\n\nWhat I totally disagree though, is using a seed phrase as the only means to recover our non-custodial wallets.\n\nThe reason is simple.\n\nPeople keep losing their seed phrase and getting scammed every day. \n\nYou might think, \"It's their fault for being dumb. Not our business.\"\n\nWell, this is not the case. It is absolutely our business.\n\nIf we really want cryptos to grow and be adopted by everyone, we need an easier way for people to own their digital assets. \n\nFurthermore, while you might have not compromised your seed phrase yet, the risk of phishing and losing it is extremely high even for experienced users.\n\nVitalik Buterin himself wrote a piece on this, titled \"Why we need wide adoption of social recovery wallets.\"\n\nIn it, he explains that we need a wallet that is easy to use and that has no single point of failure (there is no single thing that, if stolen, can give an attacker access to your funds, or if lost, can deny you access to your funds.) \n\nAt Linen Wallet, we've built exactly this type of non-custodial wallet. A wallet that is both safer and easier than standard self-custody wallets. Here's how it works:\n\n* No single point of failure: Using a smart contract, the wallet is secured with 3 keys, 2 of which are required to make a transaction. You lose one? You can still access your wallet. Someone steals one? They still can't access it.\n* Simple keys management: One key is stored in your cloud, one in your mobile device, and one in Linen's secure server infrastructure. (More options will be available in future versions)\n* No seed phrase: You can seamlessly recover your wallet using your cloud drive, email, and phone number.\n\nWe strongly believe that this setup is both safer and easier, allowing a greater adoption of cryptos. But I'd LOVE to hear from the crypto community and see if you value what we are doing. So please, ask me anything in the comment!\n\nFor more info about the wallet: [https:\/\/linen.app](https:\/\/linen.app\/)"

        "text": "We provide over 100+ FREE crypto articles on our SubStack! :D (Link on our profile). This is not financial advice.\n\n  \n\n**TLDR**:\n\nUnderstanding the two terms of APR and APY becomes even more important in DeFi today, as nearly all protocols with yield farming fields display these numbers. Knowing them well is not only for understanding and executing different strategies and calculating real profits.\n\n# General Conclusion\n\nAPR and APY are used in many yield farming programs in DeFi protocols. However, they are not the same thing! We, the participants in the market, are not only investing but actively receiving yields by farming and staking DeFi tokens. So these basic terms are not only important, but they are also information that helps you to invest more effectively.\n\nBoth are related to returns. But how are they different? Why are they not interchangeable? We discuss that in today's newsletter.\n\n# Definition\n\nAPR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It is the actual annual rate of return, **NOT** taking into account the effect of compound interest.\n\nAPY stands for Annual Percentage Yield. It is the actual annual rate of return, taking into account the effect of compound interest.\n\nWho uses what? APY is better to calculate your returns on investment while APR is more common in lending.\n\n>Quick math: which do you think is higher? APY, the one that considers compounding.\n\n# What Are They Different?\n\n## APR\n\nFor example, a yield farming program offers an APR  \n of 100%\/yr. You use $1000 to join this program. One year later you will receive $2,000, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1000 is APR  \n.\n\nOnce you see the APR, it is possible to immediately calculate how much profit will be earned at the end of the period. This profit comes from your staking or farming, so just join at the beginning to get the result for APR interest.\n\n### Formular\n\nAPR = r x N\n\nWhere:\n\nr: The interest rate of the year;\n\nN: Interest period (N = 1, means 1 year).\n\n## APY\n\nAPY is another way of calculating the percentage of real profit you will receive.\n\n>What will you get if you receive profit every day from staking and you will add that to your principle and earn interest on that **every day**?\n\nIf you have an APR  \n of 100%\/yr with getting daily profit, you have to divide APR  \n by 365 days to calculate the interest received daily (0.27%). Then reinvest this interest continuously every day. The amount you get is $2,714.57, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1714.57 is APY  \n.\n\nAssuming you participate in farming pairs on Solana's Raydium application, I also combine Step Finance to know the APR  \n and APY  \n of these farming pairs. Typically, I am staking $RAY on Raydium (current project APR is 35.33%), with $1,000 you farm at the beginning of the year to the end of the year, the total income will be $1,423.51.\n\n### Formular\n\nAPY = (1+r)\\^n - 1\n\nIn which:\n\nr: The interest rate of the period;\n\nn: Interest period (n=1 means 1 day).\n\n# Awareness\n\nAs such, today's projects often offer 2 ratios of APR and APY to show users what the rate of return is currently available. However, some projects that give daily, 7-day interest rings directly provide APY. This has two implications:\n\n* First, displaying APY  \n will produce a larger percentage than APR  \n, making brave people feel that they will receive more profit.\n* Secondly, the APY  \n interest is only true if the user reinvests (restake, refarm) continuously in the allowed period (e.g. when receiving rewards, immediately stake).\n\nToday we see a lot of aggregator protocols already using this ability to increase profits, continuously reinvesting within the capacity of the original protocols. This is really good if the transaction costs are not significant. Hopefully, we can find those solutions in Layer 2."

Have those discussions moved somewhere else? Or is r\/ethereum still the focal point, but those posts just get smothered by price hype?\n\nIt was on this subreddit that I learned how to speak economics and see through some of the veil of wall street, it was this subreddit that taught the fundamental of the Byzantine General problem, and it was this subreddit that explained the value of staking to combat the miner strike. I have saved posts explaining zkSnarks (as the development of the time) and even some pragmatic views on r\/bitcoin before it became a maximalist den.\n\nMaybe the meme of \"in it for the tech\" is fading away, but I still love learning about the developments and the different points of view for each.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, again, where do YOU get your technical news?"

I swear everywhere I look there\u2019s new projects or people flexing their collections and exuberant wealth (which they arguably did nothing to gain other than let celebs or newcomers pump their floor prices). Honestly in all of my years in crypto, despite having been involved in probably 100+ unique projects\/tokens\/ecosystems - I\u2019ve never seen such toxic people as the NFT maxi communities. It\u2019s like each one is a little annoying cult and all they want to do is remind everyone else of how much money they have and how valuable their \u201ccollections\u201d are. Tbh it gives NFT\u2019s and crypto a bad name in my book. \n\nMeanwhile Avalanche is partnering with Deloitte to provide emergency disaster insurance - and Chainlink has integrated their oracles to be used by farmers for smart contract-based disaster insurance. These are the use cases that can and are going to actually change the world - and yet these NFT maximalists are the ones hogging the spotlight (and congesting networks) all in the name of wanting to get rich and flex to everyone how smart they are and how they\u2019ve mastered the art of trading because they got lucky buying a jpeg. I swear we\u2019re going to have a wave of people claiming to be professional crypto consultants purely because they got lucky over borderline Ponzi schemes. I am welcoming a crypto winter at this point just to see these annoying groups crash\n\nEDIT: Yeah I\u2019m talking about purely \u201cdigital art\u201d NFT\u2019s where it\u2019s jpegs being hosted on a (not even decentralized) server or marketplace account. Like worthless PFP projects. I have no doubt NFT\u2019s of insurance policies (I.e. my Avalanche\/Deloitte example) will be the future. DID, insurance, patents, healthcare policies, passports, visas, ticketing, unique allergy profiles, licenses, legal contracts. All of this is the future and I happily welcome it.\n\nWorthless tacky jpeg art, not so much lol"

Please read the disclaimer, guidelines, and rules before participating.**\n\nRules:\n\n* All [sub rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Ethereum\/about\/rules\/) apply in this thread.\n* Discussion topics must be related to Ethereum.\n* Behave with civility and politeness. Do not use offensive, racist or homophobic language.\n* Comments will be sorted by newest first.\n\nUseful Links:\n\n* [Ethereum.org](https:\/\/ethereum.org)\n* [ETHHub](https:\/\/ethhub.io\/)\n* [ETHMerge.com](https:\/\/ethmerge.com\/)\n\n**Reminder**\n\n\/r\/ethereum is a community for discussing the technology, news, applications and community of Ethereum. **Discussion of the Ether price or trading is not allowed.** Please keep those discussions to [\/r\/ethfinance](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethfinance) and [\/r\/ethstaker](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethstaker).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**\n\nThere are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.\n\n**When is Eth2 launching?**\n\nEth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. \"The Merge\", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.\n\nVisit [ethmerge.com](https:\/\/ethmerge.com\/) to learn more about \"The Merge\".\n\n**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**\n\nNo, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.\n\n**How can I stake my ETH?**\n\nThere are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.\n\n* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit \/r\/ethstaker for more details\n* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https:\/\/lido.fi\/) or [StakeWise](https:\/\/stakewise.io\/)\n\n**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**\n\nLike most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.\n\n**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**\n\nEthereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.\n\nAdditionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.\n\nWhile rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https:\/\/l2beat.com\/) to learn more about rollups.\n\n**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**\n\nThe most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre there questions you'd like to see added? Leave a comment below."

For this Loopring would be way to expensive and also Immutable X ZK Rollups would introduce very high costs.\n\nSolution (short term at least)\n\n# Validiums:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/wncpo1rjira81.png?width=563&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0d24b348c5b5dbda10187ca6ac462813dc00312\n\nBy having the data availbility off chain less L1 resources are needed which will result in way more scalbility and way cheaper gas fees. But this comes with a security trade off though since they do not inherit Ethereum security.\n\nHere are their numbers.\n\nStarkware Validium (off chain data)\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/dibj02xljra81.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=a06d321a54c5181a0d704645919c6386d016ea41\n\nThis would reduce the gas fees to FRACTION of cents.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs soon as ETH sharding is live I think most people would prefer to go back to ZK rollups since they inherit Ethereums security and their scalability and gas fees improve significantly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nShort to mid term Validium will be the preferred solution over ZK rollups as long as Eth sharding is not live. As soon as Eth sharding is live Validiums will lose more and more market dominance to ZK Rollups.\n\nWhat do you guys think?"

The token is the second largest by market value after Bitcoin. Pantera is one of the earliest digital-asset investment firms and ranks in the top five of crypto-focused funds with $5.8 billion in assets. \n\nCritics of Ethereum say it has expensive fees and slow transaction speeds as traffic crowds the network. Add-ons, known as layer-2 networks, have emerged as fixes but can be complex to use, or have other disadvantages. \n\nSo-called \u201cETH-killers\u201d have gained traction with developers who use blockchain technology to build so-called decentralized finance, or DeFi applications. The namesake coins of some networks rose in returns along with use, including Solana and Polkadot. Those coins surged about 7,000% and 150% respectively over the last year even with the recent downturn in many token prices, according to data tracker CoinGecko.\n\nEther had a breakthrough year itself in 2021, hitting a record high while soaring almost 400%. That came on top of a gain of almost 500% the prior year, and has rekindled speculation that it could one day surpass Bitcoin, which currently has about double the market value of Ether. \n\nKrug, an early DeFi developer, believes competitors will eventually rely on Ethereum as a base, assuming that the blockchain successfully switches to proof-of-stake: a method of validating transactions that is promoted as being more efficient and environmentally-friendly than the current proof-of-work system.   \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s too many trade-offs other chains are making that Ethereum is not making on the decentralization side that are pretty important,\u201d Krug said, noting security concerns. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they\u2019re best suited to be the new global financial settlement layer.\u201d\n\nPantera is headed by Dan Morehead, a veteran Bitcoin investor, who was an executive at Julian Robertson\u2019s Tiger Management earlier in his career.\n\nGrayscale Investments\u2019 David Grider, head of research, says \u201call boats can be lifted\u201d in the sector. Several competitors performed strongly in the second half of 2021, Grider said. Grayscale Investments LLC offers clients a Solana investment fund. It is also exploring products related to other rivals. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s this winner-take-all type of market,\u201d Grider says. \u201cEthereum has this lead-of-a-network effect. It has this large community, but other ones have emerged that fill different market voids.\u201d\n\n[ I'm currently long-term 127.16 ETH, Staked and HODL \\(year 2026 to 2030\\) to riches!!!

        "text": " [The Beacon Chain explainer you need to read first](https:\/\/ethos.dev\/beacon-chain\/) by [Ethos.dev](https:\/\/Ethos.dev) seems like a great primer on Eth 2.0. It is a bit out of date (it's from May 2020) and doesn't mention roll ups at all.   \n\n\nI've summarized it from this podcast readthrough from [Ethereum Audible](https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/episode\/2c9XDQZBx88nRMud5BoNzK?si=d4uHuv6PT3O6mM-ffRF7oQ), would love to hear thoughts on how up to date this still is.\n\n### The basics of the beacon chain\n\nEthereum 2.0 is made up of two core aspects:\n\n1. Proof of stake consensus\n2. Sharding\n\nWhile this primer is slightly outdated and missing the rollup centric roadmap for Ethereum it gives a great overview of the other two key aspects.\n\n### Beacon chain PoS\n\nThe Ethereum PoS is broken down into block slots and Epochs. Each block slot is several seconds long in which a validator is given the role of being a block proposer. Every 32 block slots compose one epoch. Finality of blocks occurs at the end of epochs.\n\nThe structure is as follows:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Each slot is 12 seconds\n* An epoch is \\~6.4 minutes\n* Each block is verified and each slot epoch must receive 2\/3 majority to be accepted as a legitimate checkpoint\n* Once a checkpoint has been accepted it is \u2018*justified*\u2019 once the following checkpoint that links to it has been justified, the previously justified checkpoint becomes *finalized*.\n* Finalization takes an average of 2.5 epochs = 14 minutes.\n\n### Sharding\n\nOne of the Beacon chains main roles is to coordinate shards. Sharding is a technique in database management. To grow a database you can either scale horizontally or vertically.\n\n* Horizontal scaling means adding more power to each node.\n* Vertical scaling means adding more nodes.\n\nSharding is a method of vertical scaling. While the current plans for Ethereum include 64 shards, it is clear as of the beginning of 2022 that at first there will be much fewer shards and they will not be complete Ethereum replicas, rather data storage ones."

When I first discovered NFT's (crypto kitties) my thought was \"this is the future of gaming, every game will use NFTs for their assets in the future\" now they have exploded I have seen meme's  everywhere about gamers hating NFT's.\n\nWhy would you not want to own your in game assets and be able to sell them when your done with a game? Or sell them to make money from the game your playing? \n\nI often think about FIFA which is a massive game where people buy packs of cards to make a team. People love it. But every time you do that your just giving money to the company for cards that have no verifiable rearbility, can be indefinitely printed, can be take away at any point etc you get it.\n\nWhen s new FIFA game comes out your cards from the previous version do not mean shit, you can't play with them in the new game and you have to buy the cards over and over with each new version. Why are people happy to do this but have beef with NFT's\n\nNFT's work for both the company and player. You own your assets, you can sell them to make money. the game devlepor makes money from marketplace sales. Just seems like a win win for both parties.\n\nEDIT: I didn't come here to argue with any one, I want constructive conversation. Some people are taking this very personally and seem to be attacking me for asking a legit question I want some perspective on \ud83d\ude29\n\nEDIT 2: dispite the few people attacking me thanks for all the comments. You guys have helped me get a better perspective on the issue, some interesting takes I never thought of before. Excited to see how this all plays out in the future."

        "text": "To preface, I am not a big investor in crypto. Most of my money is in stocks but a small % of my invest portfolio is on Coinbase Pro as I have not done enough research to create a hardware wallet and store coins (though I do plan to in the future once I have done more research). I am fine with having it on CoinBase pro for now as I like to trade the crypto and it is not a HUGE amount.\n\nAnyways, I recently won a giveaway from a somewhat reputable crypto content creator and it was just simple NFT. There were no contingencies, I did not need to pay them money, do any post sharing, etc, I just commented and said I hoped that I would win. Anyways I won, and now they are asking me for an ETH wallet to send the prize to.\n\nSo my 2 questions are:\n\n1. Since there will be NOTHING in this ethereum wallet but the NFT I will be gifted (all my other crypto is on coinbase) is it safe to give someone else my ethereum wallet \/ seed?\n2. What application would you guys recommend? Would prefer to to be one thats easy to set up and online that can be set up in one day as I need to send them my wallet pretty soon. I have heard metamask is good, but again, have not done enough research on the different wallet types.\n\nEDIT: I checked the messages again and they wanted the Eth address. is that safe to give out?"

        "text": "So I'm late coming to the blockchain party but I've been doing a deep, comprehensive dive over the past month or so from the perspective of a developer. I find it all fascinating and definitely see the paradigm shifting nature of a decentralized web3, especially when it comes to disrupting the tech and financial giants that dominate so much of the global economy. Good on all of that.\n\nHere's the issue I'm running into: Last night I finally got around to checking out [mirrror.xyz](https:\/\/mirrror.xyz). A decentralized blog, something great in the face of totalitarian censorship. It made me think about the Chinese woman who a few years ago posted some bombshell article or accusation onto the blockchain so it could not be censored. I forget the details but that's a fantastic use case for a decentralized publishing platform. I dug into the details of [mirror.xyz](https:\/\/mirror.xyz) to learn exactly how much of the site is decentralized versus blockchain-enabled. (See [Moxie Marlinspike's blog entry](https:\/\/moxie.org\/2022\/01\/07\/web3-first-impressions.html).) This is where I learned how [mirror.xyz](https:\/\/mirror.xyz) uses Arweave to store its data, a truly decentralized and uncensorable data solution. (My first look into web3 data storage.)\n\nAwesome. But I see problems with an uncensorable future because there are definitely instances of censorship that the *vast* majority of people support: child porn, violence\/torture, blackmail. Tech companies expend a huge amount of effort in conducting this censorship. Hell, even this subreddit includes a form of censorship assuming the moderators ever take an active role in curating the community.\n\nI appreciate the desire for freedom of expression when it comes to politics and culture so let's table that debate and agree to a completely uncensored discourse. But it doesn't take much to go down the dark road of content that makes one cringe at the ability to inject something into the public record that can never be taken down and is freely accessible by anyone looking to connect to it and broadcast it.\n\nAgain, I'm new in my exploration of web3 but I haven't read much discussion about how to address this issue. The best I've seen is that KYC will prevent people from posting things they won't want to have connected to them. But that strikes me as a form of disingenuous hand waving when privacy and anonymity is so often held up as a virtue of web3. And regardless, KYC has to be chosen and implemented by the file storage provider. Or is this even true? If it's a decentralized storage blockchain, can't one just submit a transaction with the offending content and be done with it? Even if not, how long until there's a 100% privacy ensured storage option created that allows unfettered posting  of content.\n\nHappy to learn what I'm missing."

I feel like he had so much pressure on himself from a young age that anything but being the best wasn't acceptable so when he won he might of thought \"Of course i won because I'm suppose to win.\" I don't think in his mind he let himself feel how great he because in his head that was the only option. He never could accept the love and admiration from the people around him. I hope he really feels human now and happy because it's the greatest story of my generation. I can't wait for the ESPN 30 for 30 on his life."

You knew the game was going to be a disaster so the least you could do was keep showing snippets of gameplay and shut your mouth. That would alleviate the issue of no communication and ease the people into the new game mechanics. \n\nAnd then we have Andy McNamara who's 2-3 tweets are major reasons for unrest in the community. That person alone is responsible for the bad blood between DICE and the community since he has been complaining about us since day one. First complaining about us running to conclusions about the game from the beta or trailer footage, claiming those were old builds. And then again complaining about the community having brutal expectations like a scoreboard, voip, working game and good performance. To then play the victim, leading to articles made about how toxic we are.\n\nDon't forget about the lead UI designer who also complained about us judging the beta UI too quickly since it wasn't final when in fact little has changed except from kill notifications. Oh and \"Parts disabled 10XP\" Good job on that one.\n\nI'm calling out specific people because that is exactly what DICE did as well. If my post is considered toxic then that should mean DICE is too. This is the same circus like CDPR but at the very least, they never put the blame on the consumer, they took full responsibility and publicly apologized. Something DICE will never do.\n\nLearn to be more professional. You represent your companies, even if it's your personal Twitter or not.  We aren't friends, you are a producer we are a consumer. And in most businesses the customer is always right. Except when it comes to DICE, since they always know better. All the way to utter failure."

        "text": "2042 genuinely doesn't have a single decent map for any playstyle that isn't sniping or AA launching. It's just open fields upon open fields with 1 bit of cover if you're lucky and it makes ground combat horrific. The only cover is the objectives but there is nothing between the objectives. They are incredibly flat with very little verticality so you have next to no hard cover for ground vehicles and no places to hide from lock-on in air vehicles. Modes like Rush play so god awfully that it's not even funny. These are some of the worst maps I have ever played and don't work for anything except snipers on a crane or one of the few buildings to kill anyone and everyone because there is nowhere to hide from them. \n\nThen you have the Portal maps. How the fuck are the hitboxes in 10+ year old games infinitely better than they are in a game from 2021? The number of times wooden fences with big arse holes in them blocked my bullets in BC2 maps happened in a single match was ridiculous. \n\nI haven't played since when they nerfed the Heli's and jumped back on the past couple of days to see if they fixed anything and I'm just dumbfounded by the map design in this game. What happened to the days of BF3 where damn near every single map was fantastic? The DLC maps in BF3 are more memorable than a single base map in this game and they played so much better. BF4 onwards for me had much less enjoyable maps than BF3 but they weren't explicitly bad and you could still have plenty of fun on alot of them. \n\n2042 on the otherhands maps are so shit, that even if the balance, bugs were gone, specialists, classes etc. were perfect the game would still be dogshit to play because the maps just aren't fun."

        "text": "Post today on the EA Forum slating the BF fan base as salty dinosaurs who have killed the brand with their toxicity. This was the response - from a purely commercial perspective, what happened here:\n\nIt's a player base that's willing to put down $200-$300m every 2-3 years in pre orders based on brand loyalty alone, and then tens of millions per year in game passes and purchases, every year without fail. It's a customer base that has consistently shown this type of financial loyalty for literally one of the longest periods in the history of all gaming.\n\nBusiness-wise (those profits you mention) that is pretty much the best situation you can hope to achieve as a franchise. That is literally an almost perfect client base for a publisher which needs to know it can make returns on large AAA projects taking years to develop, your comment has zero basis in commercial reality.\u00a0\n\nThe mistake that EA leadership made was trying to use a highly established brand - which has become a flagship mainly by delivering an updated version of the same core experience for two decades to it's very loyal customer-base - as the vehicle for it's attempt to make new inroads into the space occupied by Fortnite\/Apex etc. in order to cash in on microtransactions.\n\nThis has failed entirely - and not because loyal BF fans aren't happy with the game. If your post had any truth to it, the new generation of players they targeted would be playing it. They aren't. And nor are the 'dinosaurs' who invested the billions that were used to make it.\u00a0\n\nNobody is playing it, because it abandoned its established core player base entirely and simultaneously failed to secure a new one in what has been an unbelievably poor commercial decision.\u00a0\n\nAll they needed to do (and I guess still could) was preserve the BF name for that franchise, keep making easy billions from those dinosaurs, and fully commit a new title to this microtransactions\/skin based hero shooter universe that they want to use.\n\nThey have done the equivalent of McDonald's launching their new vegan burger as the new Big Mac. Everyone who liked the big Mac now can't get one, and wasted chance to market your new product to the new people you want to sell to.\n\nThis whole situation will likely be used as educational material\/example for people studying brands and marketing, especially in gaming. Corporations screw up on this scale very rarely.\n\n\u00a0\nhttps:\/\/answers.ea.com\/t5\/General-Discussion\/Battlefield-Playerbase-is-a-dinosaur\/td-p\/11214353\/highlight\/false\/page\/4 is the op\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0"

They (should) know how to make more money. Yet we're here with a game from people who seriously believe ANYONE likes to have stupid specialists and quips in a war game. This is something I can't get my head around. Not even the most clichee Fortnite kid will see this game and thinks \"I need to spend money on this\". Where does this believe come from that *cringey voicelines and goofy skins* make more money than a brutal, shocking and gritty war game? How could Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare or Battlefield 1 become such iconic games then and played by players of all ages, even kids?\n\nEven games like Rainbow Six Siege are on the downfall at the moment because it's becoming more and more cringe with each season. Games like Escape from Tarkov are popular without this shit. There is still a huge audience for dark and gritty stuff and yet no one seems to care anymore..."

        "text": "I have been a player of battlefield games since BF 2. I was disappointed with 1 and V and long for the hours and hours of joy and fun provided by BF 4. The lack of support for hardcore that made the game so competitive and the lethality was real is most disappointing.  \n\nI do like the fact that I have been able to create my own hardcore server and it stays pretty full. I mean it fixes the horrible TTK in the real game. But the fact that the friends I have made over the years in this game have to leave and FARM gun parts in solo to come back and play is ridiculous. \n\nI had hope for the latest update to fix some of the bugs and quality of life issues. But alas it is more important to EA\/Dice to once again nerf all the weapons. Guns are lethal! Battlefield guns are not. I now have to exchange magazines between every attempt to down one person. If I manage to put all 7-10 shots in someone from an assault rifle before they run away, hide or hit me with their one shot sniper rifle. I am out of ammo. \n\nAnything with cannons is now useless. \n\nYou have lost your vision. And players are going back to older versions. The game is simply not fun. There is no voip so I can\u2019t meet any new BF community members nor can I communicate real-time to my squad. \n\nIt is really hard to get all of my BF friends many of more than 10 years into the same match. \n\nThis will be on deaf ears so we return to battlefield V hardcore, which is still just mediocre. \n\nEver wonder why everyone uses sniper rifles? Because they are lethal. Every gun should be lethal. The lethality should be by the ammunition type. Not by \u201cI think an M5 should take 7 shots to kill and the Vcar which likely uses the same round takes 5.\u201d  \n\nAll I hear in our party chat (because we can\u2019t talk in game) is \u201cnobody dies!!!!!!\u201d\n\nI am sure the next patch will fix the game by replacing bullets with foam balls. \n\nThanks"

Just your soldier standing there like a dumbass. \n\nThen AT LEAST change the specialist system a little. Like for example make weapons and gadgets class specific but keep the specialists so you can keep making money I guess. \n\nThen show us a roadmap of what content we can expect during the best few months. And this also means that we want a lot of content, not just a new gun and map every few months.\n\nMake the tone of the game much darker, sell realistic military skins for the specialists, make the dlc maps more war torn and gritty and keep on adding to the story. (This one is just my opinion and isn\u2019t vital for the game\u2019s success)\n\nAnd then at last, make the game more polished. Animations, lighting, performance and bugs all need work. \n\nWith all of these changes I would genuinely start playing this game again"

        "text": "I think we're talking a year before the game gets to a good place. If they don't give up on it altogether. Not sure how they salvage it at this point. They sure are dragging their feet on giving us a road map. Almost think they're just gonna make another ww2 or ww1 game next. Which I'm sick of. That category  has been featured so much over the last 5 years. And the last 2 bfs. 1 and 5 are still really fun.. Why can't we get some modern shooters that compare to the ones from 10 years ago. Modern graphics with the old reliable gameplay we know we love. To be honest I still like this game. But it's super frustrating to play. Not being able to adjust the hud correctly is mind boggling. I can't see who I'm shooting at when they're around the capture points because the the hud bubble is so large and so low to the ground that it will literally hide most medium size buildings at certain ranges. And the way the sights at all times seems to be swaying around, even in a tank that's sitting still. The gameplay is still so sloppy feeling. And it's crazy that you can fix some of the problems with how bad the gunplay feels by adjusting some of the settings. Field of view as an example. Why are these settings not default yet. Ppl new to game have no idea. No wonder they don't stick around. These are just a few of the issues that I don't see mentioned very much. Theres a much larger list of known problems that have been around since the beta. I last complaint is what I feel needs to be addressed the most. Maps. The has got to be a way to add some cover between cap points. Even if they are the terrible steel containers. And add the portal the maps into a aow map rotation. Maybe that would help. I don't see how it could hurt at this point. And also add the portal weapons and gadgets too. They're already in the game. Just find a way to implement it before it's too late. I think these are types of changes that would get ppl back and keep new ppl playing the game. And if it's gonna take a couple months to make these changes. Tell us about it now. Don't just keep saying that your not sure what direction your gonna take the game. You've got a better chance of keeping ppl if you tell them you are gonna make the changes they want. We've been hearing for a month now that you have no clear direction for the game. You can't seem to decide what your gonna do next. Just super vague twitter questions to the community about what they want. And that you'll think about the feedback we give you. Then we get patch notes with a scoreboard that still doesn't show kills and deaths. Then we're asked about free to play. Which needs to happen. But not until youve fixed the biggest gameplay issues first. It won't matter. Even though you'll get more ppl playing for a couple weeks. They'll all leave again. I think the road map they should release is.. Fix gameplay bugs quickly. Add maps and guns\/gadgets for portal into aow. Add aow sever browser. Fix maps and add content along the way.  \nI dunno. What do you think the road map should be?"

Tom Henderson made a great behind the scenes video about problem in the production.\nI looked further back and found an incredibly insightful article from 2019, where problems with the frostbite engine became overwhelming and already destroyed a few titles (Mass Effect Andromeda e.g.).\nThe similarities are mindblowing:\n\"Mass Effect: Andromeda began pre-production in 2013, but by 2015 BioWare Montreal was cutting out the concept of procedurally-generated planets. Ultimately, due to this lack of direction, BioWare Montreal had to scramble to create the final version of Andromeda, most of the work coming in the last 18 months. And Mass Effect: Andromeda didn't fully right the ship prior to launch. Instead, it had a host of bugs and poor animations, leading to poor reviews and a bad reception in the community. Ultimately, BioWare Montreal was shuttered and merged in EA Motive.\"\n\nA lead programmer said the following about the engine:\n\"Frostbite is easily the worst, shittiest, most pain in the ass engine I've ever used in my career, and I shipped Wolfenstein off the Doom 3 tech,\" said Heir on Twitter. \"The exact same game design in Unreal vs. Frostbite will take dozens more engineers, money, and time on FB because of the way its architected and how far behind it is from Unreal (unless you are making BF). There is a reason I chose Unreal Engine 4 as my engine for my next project.\"\n\nConclusion:\nBattlefield 2042 is dead and there is no chance to repair it.\nThis might end the franchise.\nSwitching to another engine (unreal engine) would cost EA a lot of licencing fees and isn't likely.\nI honestly see no future for Battlefield anymore.\n\nHere is the link to the full article:\n[full article link:](https:\/\/www.usgamer.net\/articles\/ea-frostbite-engine-history-bioware-ea-sports)"

Just wanted to voice my opinion on what they gotta do to make up for those who paid for the game. If you didn\u2019t get the game, not sure what your doing in this thread, it litteraly doesn\u2019t concern you.\n\nEdit 2: Some got the wrong idea, no I don\u2019t want it to go f2p, Im just saying IF it where to happen due to rumors. \n\nHonestly I was sold on a broken promise, the games is absolutely nothing like the first two trailers shown that hyped us up. Thats the crap I paid 90$ for. This was the first game I actually pre ordered on pc and got bit in the ass for it.\n\nThe game currency should be equal to the edition we paid for and the shit we got \u201cextra\u201d like the battle passes are just the bonus for getting conned. Hope im actually playing the game by then because honestly im tired of having hope for this game.\n\nAnd come on, the maps shouldn\u2019t be too hard to re do. Drop in more assets on the field to create cover. Make changes ala rainbow six siege map reworks. 100% sure its possible. Copy paste buildings if they have to, probably better than what we got."

        "text": " If you ever have been in business school like I have, then you would be taught things like thinking outside the box or a \"Blue Ocean Strategy\" as they say. The reason why 2042 has changed so much is because developers are convinced that doing the same thing from past Battlefields would cause people to complain about \"not innovating\" or \"being lazy\" and not creating anything new. So developers went the route of creating a game unlike anything before. They are convinced that removing classes, crating specialists, having 128 players, and creating a \"hazard zone\" would be praised by gamers for being \"innovative\". The risk of doing the same game over and over was too much, and they needed something \"new\" for BF players. This is not just following a trend of having specialist skins or being in a royal type of game, this is also about out competing your competitors. They would be convinced enough that despite the flaws that this new game would create, players would forgive them because its a \"innovative\" game. For example, Call of duty had been criticized in the past for creating the same game over again. This is why we started to get games like Advance Warfare and other games using the exo suites. For many players, like me, this type of gameplay ruined Call of duty and turned people away. Players did not like other players flying around, and the mechanics of the game started to get goofy. This is what happens when people try to \"innovate\". Does it work sometimes? Yes, but most often it creates problems that creators have to address and figure out how to improve or change their \"innovation\" to what does work. If enough time passes and problems still persist, then drastic change needs to happen. This is what happened to Call of duty with M.W.\/2019. Going back to the roots and creating the classic boots on the ground with no bells and whistles. Sure enough, it worked despite it being like the past MW games. This just proves you don't have to innovate in a drastic way, but recognize what works and continue to build on past success that made games successful. For Battlefield, improving the graphics, gunplay, and unique environmental destruction would have been a better strategy of \"innovating\" without drastic changes. I'm not saying Specialists or having 128 players is a bad thing, but that type of change was needed to be experimented for longer and planned out better to see what works or not. Completely changing the game from what was tried and loved was more of a risk than innovation, and is now causing problems with the whole community. Developers cannot be living in a bubble, they need to understand their customers. Focusing on the here and now with microtransactions and such instead of the future is a losing strategy. Having people come back to your games years down the road because they are fun\/enjoyable\/bug free\/etc... is how you succeed. I don't know what will become of 2042, but with out change, or solid feedback from developers, this game will quickly end up a mess and easily lose out to competition."

But since the lock-on has the range of a nerf gun, they just hit the flares and fly away until they can get them back, since for whatever reason, flares make them immune to the lock on for a long time afterwards. I assumed hacking them would disable the flares, but I don't understand how this works. I hack the aircraft and it says hack complete, but it seems like nothings happening and if I keep holding it, he'll start tapping his wristwatch. Then after that, I still can't get a lock-on. I'm getting fed up with this game."

There were 5 map packs, coming out to a total of 20 new maps within the first two years or so.\n\nBattlefield 2042 released with 6 maps. Each season will have one new map.

It's obvious that they have been cut down to make the game run at all with 128 players. \n\nIn the first 2 months there has been a lot of criticism and unbridled hate. But some optimistic voices still held on. \n\nNow even those are crumbling, ever more creators jumping ship and communities are falling apart. This could well be the end of the battlefield community. \n\nMy first BF was BF1 but I quickly grasped how passionate the fans of the franchise are and actually joined reddit due to bf.

We were lied to and we were deceived. \n\nI believe EmbarkStudios has the absolute potential to give players what they want. \nAs you can see everyone is hungry for a game that has the mechanics and realism of battlefield 1, modern shooter slightly abit more updated than battlefield 4 nitty and gritty and a scoreboard. \n\nThere is a massive gap in the market for similar style games to battlefield 3\/4 with the mechanics of BF1. And as no one will ever trust EA again, i believe this is your time to shine. You guys gave us memories alot of us miss. \n\nAlot of gamers here genuinely enjoyed the games you built. I believe we deserve another one. So please give the players what they want and you\u2019ll have a dedicated fan base as addicted as i am to my heroine pipe. Now where\u2019s my lighter while i watch battlefields player count drop. \n\n\n(Oh and I\u2019m still not downloading this game even if it\u2019s free. Infact EA would have to pay me to play battlefield 2042)"

        "text": "It goes without saying that most of these AAA games come with their fair share of cheat sellers that will compromise the game in order to make a revenue stream. BF2042 is no exception. Even with the current state of the game, and claims within online media that even the nefarious cheat sellers have bailed on it because of the bad state of the game... are just not true. Just minutes ago...I had the slight hope that I could have muster a few games on portal, and try to have some fun with the game.... even with the low player count... only to realise that the game is evidently full of wallhackers and such. \n\nI've been gaming for 25+ years and I know it when I see it. Not to mention the inherent bugs and Alpha-state of the game? That is the final nail in the coffin for me. The cheats....It happened in PUBG, it happened in Warzone, It happened in BF4...I didn't play enough of BF1 & 5 to see it... and now it is rife in 2042. I'm so done.  Uninstalling it, along with Origin, and EA play as I type. Waiting on Dying light 2 and Stalker 2. Fuck EA. I kinda still feel bad for DICE though. They have become EA's slave now. The Studio most probably won't be around in 5 years time. I'll go back to playing Insurgency Sandstorm for a proper mil shooter now.\n\nIt's time we just pissed on this dumpster fire of an excuse for a AAA game. I smell a class-action lawsuit in the near future."

        "text": "It\u2019s not about this game, it\u2019s not about profit, it\u2019s about EA\u2019s and DICE\u2019s reputation now. They **have to** turn this game around or they will lose a huge part of their community for a foreseeable future. They F'ed up Battlefield V, Battlefront 2, Anthem, and Battlefield 2042. It's enough.\n\nTurning this game free 2 play is **not** the answer and there will be **more backlash**.\n\nAbandoning this game is the **worst** possible thing that they can do right now.\n\nTheir only option is to **fix this game**. It\u2019s **easy**. It\u2019s not as hard as many of you think it is. What the playerbase wants is very straightforward, but I'm going to repeat it once more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. It\u2019s boring to hear this again, but remove specialists. Bring classes back. It\u2019s not that hard. The system is **ready**, it is working in Portal. You have lots of generic-looking soldier models ready. You can even put a helmet on the specialists\u2019 heads and use them as extra models.\n\nThis is a very time-sensitive problem that needs to be fixed asap, because the moment that Season 1 goes live and you start releasing skins and uniforms for the existing Specialists, it\u2019s irreversibly ruined.\n\nDo you want to sell cosmetics and earn money? Do what Modern Warfare 2019 did exceptionally well. There are two different teams of characters in MW2019, and each team has several factions (replace them with classes in Battlefield). These characters don\u2019t have any ability or superpower, but they have different looks and personalities. Sell skins and uniforms for them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. Put current specialists\u2019 abilities as gadgets for different classes.\n\n2.1. Add Riot Shield as a secondary weapon.\n\n2.2. Add smart grenades as normal throwables.\n\n2.3. Remove Turrets.\n\n2.4. Remove Armor.\n\n2.5. Remove Wallhack goggles.\n\n2.6. Remove the ability to hack soldiers. Don\u2019t mess with players' UI.\n\n2.7. Remove Drone (preferably) or nerf it and add it as a gadget for the Recon class.\n\n2.8. Add Grapple Hook and Wingsuit as a gadget for the Assault class.\n\n2.9. Add Deployable Shield as a gadget for the Support class.\n\n2.10. Add Falk\u2019s healing pistol as a gadget for the Medic class.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Add all existing and future Portal\u2019s weapons to the base game. It\u2019s guerrilla warfare basically. Soldiers are fighting with any weapon they can find. They are not picky. What is the shame in using M1 Garand in the year 2042?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. Add the Scoreboard. I\u2019m not talking about that abomination you showed us on Twitter. Just copy-paste previous games\u2019 scoreboards, please.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5. Bring back the server browser. People can\u2019t find full matches in most regions. Just add it back. It's not that hard once again, the system is **ready** and is used in Portal.\n\n5.1. Add featured servers to Portal\u2019s server browser.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n6. Start pumping maps with different player counts and **don't force 128 players in all the maps, it's not working.**\n\nThis game needs 3-4 maps each season (at least). Bring back iconic maps from previous Battlefields and re-imagine them with the current theme of the game. Add infantry-focused maps (Metro is a good start).\n\nStart reworking current maps. Add more stuff around, reposition the objectives, change the layout, add more destructible structures, and more.\n\nRemove Hourglass, please (or don't, I'm biased)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n7. Remove Hazard Zone. Bring Criterion and tell them to make a BR mode with a **completely new map**. Release it as a free 2 play mode. Basically Warzone. Don\u2019t do it now, do it when the game is fixed and ready.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n8. Add Platoons, clan tags, emblem editor, stat tracker, squad management, spectator mode, voice chat, all chat, dog tags, scope zeroing (wtf?), spawn on all vehicles, 8-man squads for 128 players mode, end of the round map selection (and persistent lobbies of course), end of the round best squad (instead of this cringey solo players), friend joining, and every other basic feature you removed from the game.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n9. Add full XP in Portal and remove XP gained by killing bots. Don't grant XP for killing bots and the XP farming problem is solved. Is it that hard?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n10. Fix game-breaking bugs and improve performance...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo these and you still won't have a perfect game, but the outcome is a **playable Battlefield**.\n\nAnd I know they won't listen and won't do any of these, but anyway, I don't care anymore   \\*\\*\u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_\/\\*\\*\u00af"

This toggle would allow for full XP to be earned in the trade off for restricting tools for the creator. This allows them to not have to worry about people exploiting settings as they can control which setting people can change. When its turned off users would have full access to change the settings in portal\n\nYou could also filter servers by full XP enabled allowing people to find servers that allow this quicker."

Fortunately, they managed to make this game be \"okay\" and not total disaster. The only reason this game didn't die it's because the game doesn't look like it was presented on the famous trailer.\nAnd they managed to make a good Pacific DLC. \n\nPeople enjoy realistic, brutal gameplay with fantastic attention to detail - just the way Battlefield 1 was. \n\nIt was really easy job. Just give people modern version of Battlefield 4 + Portal.\nIt could have been the best battlefield in the series. \n\nAnd what they have decided to do?  \nLet's make a hero shooter !\nMore microtransations ! Fancy skins ! Cringy voice lines! \nIgnore the quality and attention to detail!\n\nLet's give the players unplayable game, they will love it and wait for further fixed because we implemented changes that apparently everyone's wants in Battlefield...\n\nIt's not even that they want to make a Fortnite out of it.\nSeriously, the game is in a such state that even 2011 Battlefield 3 has better gameplay mechanics than this game...\n\n \nI don't understand that..."

There are people who just want to be a soldier in a big battlefield and run around, ride around, fly around, play as a squad member etc. Battlefield just gave that literally. No, we are not asking for bunch of heroes running around, killing same characters, with superhero abilities. I do not have to give you more background than this because I am sure there are people in your company knows all this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen suddenly you started implementing things from other fps games that would destroy the core values of Battlefield, in the name of Live Service etc. There are proven formulas of this game that made it successful. You do NOT have that anymore. This game is turning into yet another live-serviced, microtransaction riddled fps game. I mean, even basic scoreboard is being altered. Why? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also would love to hear the decision makers thoughts of why exactly you are changing this franchise to what is not. Should not even use the word Battlefield for a game that isn't even it. Gaming industry is changing, in a bad way. A big company like you sets up the standard. Rather than chasing money, you should let money chase you. I mean, you are the expert in this right? Why chase money so badly that clouds your mind to even change such a proven franchise into a mess that is now in this status? Battlefield should be Battlefield. Please go back to basics, use the successful formula, listen to community, then make a game that the gamers can call it \"Battlefield\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo more being stuck up up with your own thoughts. I thought bf5 taught you lesson. This got even worse which proved you have learned nothing except for creating a good trailer. \n\nPlease please save this franchise."

Maxing out guns I would never use in game, maxing out specialists who are generally useless in game against players (Boris, Paik, Dozer) \n\nZombies brought some fun, albeit ridiculous fun back to the game. \nThen they take it out? What were we unlocking too many T1 skins? \nDoes dice think that everyone having T1 skins effects the balance and flow of the game? Do they realize that was the only thing bringing me back? \n\nI was optimistic about 2042 eventually turning around but this whole move has killed any hope I had. Some of you probably think im just crying and you\u2019re happy they removed the only fun playlist yet to come to 2042 and to those of you saying that I ask you: what makes you play 2042? Is it the non existent stats? Or the broken hit registration? How about the unbalanced non existent class system where anyone and their grandma can spawn with rockets and c5? \nOr is it playing the same 3 shitty maps over and over and over?"

I liked Breakthrough, and how you could basically make your own class. Particularly, leveling up your weapons is what kept us coming back... until we realized the attachments are basically reskins and don't matter unless its for silencing. The longer we played the more it became obvious that the game was just...empty. Same static maps, same strategy (hold point until the vehicles blow you up), and all for pretty much nothing until the season starts in March. Its boring.\n\nI got it through EA play pro, so I'm wondering which Battlefield is best to move on to?

I feel like that splits the player base too much though.\n\nMy idea would be just have classes\u2026 within those classes they lock you into a couple gadget options (example would be engineers choose between the AA rockets or ground rockets). within that class you pick a specialist that is preset as that class and you get their passive and active ability.\n\nThis way you could pick support and choose between Irish, Boris, or angel for example. They all choose ammo kits or some other gadget that fits the role and then they pick one of those 3 specialists to get the special abilities of whichever specialist.\n\nI feel like this is a way to kind of fix the classes issue without completely overhauling the game when we know we need more content and fixes as well. Thoughts?\n\nTLDR: lock gadgets to a class system and put specialists into a class to use"

I just want to share my piece and let everyone know who they should approach this never ending issue of corporate greed, lies, and abuse. I'm keeping this short and simple.\n\nDo not and I repeat do NOT take anything a streamer tells you at face value. Streamers are not your friends and they are not your family. Beyond the medium that the two of you exist in, they are nothing more than entertainers. Does this make their opinions invalid? Most definitely. Streamers and content creators have become nothing but paid gaming lobbyist and if you think corporations do not use them as leverage for their PR campaigns then you probably still leave cookies out for Santa every winter.\n\n**Do not let anyone skew what YOU think is right. What you think should be done. What you think you should feel. You are a consumer are entitled to your right to disagree with predatory business practices. You have a right to express yourself. No one owns you.**\n\nDon't let anyone take that away from you or convince you otherwise. \n\nDisclaimer: I do not condone violence or threats. I just want you all to know that what you are doing drives changes. Moving and and playing \"another game\" does nothing to hold a company accountable for unjustly profiting millions upon millions from hard working individuals.

Make it free. Then you can sell skins and other MTX like EA wanted all along.\n\nTLDR: people praising V only after 2042 came out have given EA\/Dice the roadmap they need to turn 2042 into a F2P with MTX and essentially turned the community into being a revenue-generating beta testing community"

There are bigger problems in this list I feel should be addressed well before the scoreboard. \n\nFor me the cross play would be the first thing I disabled because with it off it\u2019s near impossible to begin a match and I feel that with it on drives console players away because of the obvious disadvantage vs pc. (Cross console only option)\n\nSecondly the bugs because again this drives players away. Stuttering and rubberbanding along with no load outs and all the others drive players away.\n\nThen no browser and legacy squad functions making it impossible to play with more than 3 friends hurts player retention.\n\nNext is voip. Without this function it becomes impossible to coordinate random players in the same squad and also prevents new players from making new friends who also play the game. Battlefield has always been much easier with a coordinated squad regardless of skill level. \n\nNow removal of classes in favor of specialists. Specialists don\u2019t bother me to much as they provide new ways to play however I believe they make balancing decisions very difficult.\n\nSo the question is what do you feel is the biggest contributor to loss of players?"

I am sure, I am not the only one, who spent countless hours playing bf1 with no hud, just immersing yourself in this dark ww1 experience. And it really worked even in multiplayer! \nWhat is even better is how easy it was to switch between this two opposite \"feels\" of the game. You don't have to change a gamemode or reload a client or something. This change may happen during respawn in a single game, and this is a gameplay change, for obvious reasons: you will move differently, execute different tactics and so on. \nI don't see at all how \"immersion\" mode can be achieved in bf2042 with all its family-friendly stupidity and cringe"

Ea must own enough companies to where another can see.\nIf they do stay as the developers, they should really just come read this sub for a while, it will basically tell them what people want. \nIn another point, will there be another battlefield anytime soon? Or will it be scrapped because ea can't understand why noone likes it anymore? If ea was smart they would remaster 3 and 4, put them together and send it out.

EA and the remnants of DICE have shown they are lazy, have no idea what they are doing, what the players want, purely profit driven and have lied to us to get to this point.\n\nWould it be that far of a stretch to let this forum die as well. If we just stopped posting, and left. Yes it's just subreddit forum of passionate and pissed off players and it doesn't encompass the entire player base, but if we stopped participating, in acting like we care, that could send a message which isn't just about money.\n\nOr perhaps I say good bye to this sub reddit, and completely move on from this mess."

They could have had loads of different progression based unlocks for each slot and then let you piece together your own cool looking soldier. Maybe they could have added camouflage options to each separate piece also. All 4 of the original classes could have their own unlocks and you would be able to create something unique for each one. this would be great customisation and could easily be monetised fairly and unoffensively. People want to be some version of themselves on the battlefield and not some smooth talking loser psycho. Some of this stuff could also be found in the Hazard Zone to be extracted? as an incentive to actually go in there."

And that game is a fucking MASTERPIECE. Every match is so intense. Hiding from a tank while it destroys the house, everythink is shaking, the music is gorgeous, you listen for every step, you are emerged in that game.

Assault with meds and revives , engineer with smg and anti vehicle , support with big guns and ammo and recon with the ability to snipe or be aggressive with an ar or smg or shotgun this is when battlefield is fun .\nThe specialist with random skill set that 90% are useless is not battlefield . The whole loadout selection UI is terrible over complicated and confusing \n\nIt\u2019s pretty  sad that the most fun I\u2019ve had on bf2042 is playing noshar canals conquest"

There are so many passionate and talented people creating things solely out of love for games and wanting to bring a better experience to players that we could truly gain an endless amount of playability. This would also alleviate some stress\/pressure from DICE, as they could focus their efforts better on the core experience of the game. \n\nI realize that mod support goes entirely against EA's micro-transaction scheme, but I feel that 2042 needs it now more than ever if they expect us to stick around."

Am I just looking at this all wrong? I get that the benefit to the specialist is to have those abilities without using the equipment slot but even more so with the grenade slot having the same abilities as the specialists I think the design behind the specialists we got at launch is just bad game design.\n\nEdit: I don\u2019t understand why this post has become so combative?

I didn\u2019t try to bait an aggressive back and forth argument about who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s subjective anyways."

For some reason, the high power extended mag (only high power available for K30) has 30 rounds compared to standard extended which has 40, and it has a slower fire rate, but the other stats are the same? So why would anyone use the high power extended? Unless the stats just aren't accurate to actual application?\n\nAnd you get the cobra grip at 120 kills which boosts accuracy and range by 20 and 5 when static, respectively. Then 60 kills later at 180 total, you unlock the LWG grip, which only boosts accuracy by 10 when static? Why is the one you unlock later worse?\n\nSeriously...who designed this?"

Do you ever go through the scoreboard at the end of the game scanning people's K\/Ds thinking to yourself \"haha, that guy with 0.5 is such a loser\"? In a casual game like BF? I've never had this thought process, the only thing I do is look at the score of some of the guys at the top. \n\nBut do you know what actually annoys me? When people don't PTFO. Every now and then I get a glimpse of someone having a very good K\/D but a pathetic score. It doesn't automatically mean that said person is useless (sometimes you get a lot of kills simply trying to defend the objective), but it's usually a good indication that all they do all game is pick a nice location and farm kills all day long without much awareness of what is happening in the game. And for me personally, this is worse than some shitty K\/D that barely means anything, especially if you PTFO and have a good score.\n\nSo why don't they just deactivate the score as well so that nobody can judge me based on my kills to score ratio? After all, it might hurt my feelings, right?\n\nThere will always be something that potentially gives people an opportunity to judge others. That's something you must deal with if you play a PvP game. I think the K\/D isn't the worst in this respect by far."

Frankly the servers are dead and it sucks I spent $60 on a game I can barely play, so the idea of making parts of the game or all of the game doesn\u2019t make me so mad if it populates the servers again. Anyhow here\u2019s what I propose:\n\n\n1.) make the AOW section of the game free to play, portal you have to upgrade and buy the game to get.\n\n2.) 2042 Breakthrough mode, only 128 game mode. 2042 maps only (I feel like this is the only mode where 128 players is okay in)\n\n3.) also in the AOW section of the game make conquest Standard 64 players and get rid of 128 player conquest, and bring in all the portal maps and guns put then on rotation.\n\n4.) standard TDM, Rush and Domination modes with all portal maps and guns as well on The AOW section.\n\n5.)in fact just bring all the portal guns to standard bf 2042 and make it so we can progress and unlock attachments and camos \n\n6.) get ride of hazard zone until you can fix it or change it to a battle royal that\u2019s decent \n\n\nI know these things won\u2019t happen but it\u2019s definitely something they could change rather quickly and hopefully make this game playable again.

If they just pulled out the Battlefield from the title the game would never have gotten remotely as much hate. On the other hand Battlefield 2042 is garbage, Battlefield or not.\n\n I'm writing this because i saw some delusional people on this sub saying that this game would've been well recieved if it didnt have Battlefield in its name. If you truly unironically believe that it's time to go to the doctor get that brain checked out. \n\nThis game was DOA, it wasnt for Fortnite kids and BR players which have been playing FREE games for years now. It wasnt for Tarkov fans certainly not with that pathetic hazard mode which managed to flop harder than Firestorm. It most certainly wasnt aimed at Battlefield fans or Call of Duty fans. It was an aimless project, made by soulless Electronic Arts suits that don't play video games ever. I am convinced that the people at EA that enabled this don't even know if we are at the playstation 2 or 12.\n\nI think that this game would've been a find competitor to Planetside 2, DUST 514 and Blacklight Retribution if it was free to play, it's the only space where it could compete and do well. It might have been able to steal the 14 players still on Planetside 2, maybe."

I get why it\u2019s gone but I think it should\u2019ve been left there. There\u2019s hardly any players in my servers anyways. I get some people really had to grind but that\u2019s not our fault.

        "text": "Hello everyone,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nL.E.: This is not a hate post. This is not a call to all the players, this message is for people that love Battlefield but are disappointed in the current state of the game, are tired of screaming at clouds and see that DICE will not hear us out. Its my humble opinion that only by not playing the game, DICE Heads will do something at last. If you enjoy the game, i truly envy you and i hope one day i will enjoy it as well.\n\nLong time lurker here, average player since BF3, just as disappointed as everyone else with this game. Won't reiterate every problem and suggestion. Just a simple idea: Stop playing the game. That's the simplest and best thing you can do right now. It is clear that Dice is not listening to the fans and when they do, they take 4 months (or more) to implement a basic feature like score board. Do not enrage yourself with anger and disappointment. We all love this game, that's why we consume ourselves and our sanity here.\n\nThings will not change or not as fast as we wish while there is no incentive to do so. So if you can't ask for money back for the game, the next best thing is to stop playing the game. The numbers will plummet to the ground (at the time of writing this, the numbers were awful  3,462playing 7 min ago  -  6,945 24-hour peak \\[on Steam\\]) May then Dice will try to save this game by, at least, finish it, or move alone and pull an Anthem. Either way, at the moment, we all are beating a dead horse.\n\nI've stop playing since late December and returned to BF V and BF I. I suggest you do the same, wait and hope Dice will do something.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Stop playing the game if you are not please with the state it's in right now, its the best way of showing your displease."

Fantastic memories and long time friendships were made back then.\n\nBattlefield 4 on PlayStation...rocky start but sunk a good couple of hundred hours into the game. I loved the game and finally learned how to snipe. A+\n\nBattlefield One....oh man. I remember staying up late with party chat with my friends waiting for the trailer to drop ( I believe it was an E3 ). And oh man that trailer was fire \ud83d\udd25!\n\nThe Martini Henry...that sound, the satisfaction after a one shot kill... Sweet memories.\n\n\nBattlefield V was a bit different, the trailer was, well, different, I didn't get the buzz after seeing it. Still bought it and enjoyed it a lot with the new, quick TTK. Loved the movement system. Overall had fun but less than with the previous entries. \n\nAnd here we are with a new battlefield game. \n\nThank God I switched to Xbox and I didn't have any friends to play with, otherwise I would have bought this on day one.\n\nI honestly can't imagine how I would  feel if I bought the game. Reading this sub every once in a while is just devastating. I felt like Dice knows they can't mess up with this one after all the controversy around BFV and the bad decisions they made down the line. \n\nI hoped they will show they still have it, they can put down a finished product. But no, they can't. And I don't think I will buy anything from these guys anymore. It feels really bad to see one of my favourite game franchises go down like this. \n\nStay strong guys and learn from this. Do not preorder anything in the future."

I've also had them go through a helicopter that was hovering. I think I got a total of 4 or 5 hits out of like 100+ thrown smart grenades against helicopters by this point.\n\nI tried to use them against tanks\/boltes\/etc. but they seem pointless for that as well as they will often target some random jet that is scraping on the sky ceiling instead of the vehicles that is in clear unobstructed vision 30m right in front of me.\n\nI thought they might prioritize spotted vehicles, but that also doesn't seem the case.\n\nThe only \"use\" for them I've found so far is maybe baiting pilots into popping flares and giving up on the idea of actually doing damage with them. A bit like a less clunky Rao.\n\nSo, again: When am I supposed to use them? Am I supposed to use them at all or should i just use the scatter grenade instead?\n\nThanks in advance\n\n---\n\nedit: one \"the\" too many in the title. alas.\n\nApparently the greandes are called \"Anti-Armor\" grenades which are part of her \"Smart Explosives\"."

I miss the good old days and so I\u2019m going to do what I should have done months ago, jump ship. I just purchased BF1 and I\u2019m going to go and actually enjoy a game that I never got around to playing. I\u2019ll keep BF2042 installed with the slimmest hope that it might be improved in any significant way down the the road. But for now, goodbye. It\u2019s sad to see how far this franchise has fallen and it\u2019s unfortunately not all on EA for once, rather DICE. I grew up loving their earlier BF and Star Wars titles but now I don\u2019t feel any connection or bond, rather a cold corporate machine beating to death the games that we love. Much love and Godspeed soldiers!\n\nEdit: If the game is given a chance to improve and change then I will definitely give it a try again.

        "text": "Some of you may have seen a recent report that EA is not happy with the performance of 2042 (duh) and are considering a free to play future.\n\nWhat are the thoughts on this? Pros, we get way more players, cons, it\u2019s clearly a play to get more people on to spend money on the skins too.\n\nI don\u2019t mind that as no one is forced to buy skins, but there is the concern that focusing on that can take away from other things. Still, I would side on having a more healthy player base if that was the cost and the game is actually good by then (I can\u2019t imagine it will be any time soon cause bringing people into the game now would not be a good idea since the game is in a trash state and I\u2019m assuming this game won\u2019t go free until it\u2019s actually good, unless EA really has no shame). \n\nOne question I have is: what does it mean for us, who paid for the game? \n\nI paid for the $100 early access (I know\u2026) and if they go free, I can\u2019t help but feel like at the end of the day, all we did was get fooled into paying for an Alpha test marketed as a full release, and paying heavily to do \u201cwork\u201d that EA should be playing real QA testers for. Playing a game is not work, but playing an incomplete game and reporting issues is essentially what testers do (and get paid for).\n\nPUBG, I paid for, but would not expect them to make it \u201cright\u201d to me now that it\u2019s F2P because I got a complete game when I paid, and the game has been out for years so it makes sense mainly because that game could use more players, and it\u2019s actually satisfying to see the company recognize this and go free. I feel like EA sees this too (good) but considering I got nothing for what I paid, it makes me sick (bad).\n\nSo the question remains and I\u2019m curious on everyone\u2019s thoughts: how can EA make it right to us who paid and essentially funded this game mid production? Do any of you feel same to me?"

As a long standing fan of the series, my loyalty and patience are being tested in equal measure. \nAnd for christ sake create a class\/clown with counter electronic spotting. You go all out to pull a smart flank to get wiped out by some ass hat in an md540 who spots you instantly and flodds the area with rockets. Getting boring now!! Tactical play is all but dead in battlefield!\nAnd where the hell is hardcore mode!?"
