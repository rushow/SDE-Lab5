After completing my master's in Rehabilitation Sciences under the supervision of my amazing and supportive professor, Dr. Shu-Ping Chen, at the University of Alberta Faculty of Rehabilitation Medicine, I successfully passed the equivalency assessment process for internationally educated OTs (SEAS) and became a provisional registered OT in British Columbia province.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNow I am thrilled to announce that as of January 2022, I started the next chapter of my journey by joining Salius Rehab Inc. as a Provisional Occupational Therapist. Special thanks to Sonia Singla and Julia Pereira who provided me with this opportunity to join their awesome professional team, learn, and grow!",
