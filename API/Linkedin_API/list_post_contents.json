        "content": "This is the post I've been waiting to make for what feels like FOREVER!  I have watched so many amazing and talented members of the #Ohana start (or continue) their journeys as Salesforce Professionals and now I am ECSTATIC to share that I've joined the ranks: I am a Salesforce CERTIFIED Administrator!\n\nIn January 2021, I took the Five-Day Challenge from #TalentStacker and decided that Salesforce wasn't for me.  I did not believe that I could transition from a successful career as a teacher to someone who works in tech.  I left my teaching job in May and ventured into the unknown.  I continued to teach online classes, which were amazing and I loved keeping that connection to my students and to a field I love.  Because of some changes to the online ESL teaching company I worked for, I realized that I needed to figure out my next steps quicker than I had planned.  \n\nFast forward to the end of August, my husband and I were enjoying a nice walk and we started talking about #FinancialIndependence, #ChooseFI, and then #Salesforce.  In the span of a few conversations, my husband convinced me that I did have \"what it takes\" and my skills as a teacher would be transferable to anything new I tried.  He continued to push me and believe in me, which ultimately led me to this day.  I could not be happier to be a Salesforce Certified Administrator.  \n\nThere are so many people to thank because no one EVER does anything alone.  First, (and you might have guessed this one), thank you to my wonderful and supportive husband, Noah Farber-Jones.  If he hadn't continued to send #Salesforce and #Talentstacker information my way, I would not be sharing this post today.\n\nThank you to my amazing study mates, Angie Tinio and Kathy Umanzor, who kept me focused on my studying goals and made learning Salesforce even more fun!  I cannot wait to hear their success stories in the very near future!\n\nThank you to Caitlin Nguyen for your amazing videos on Trailhead Live that taught me about data analytics, permission sets, and validation rules!  \n\nThank you to Martin Gessner for the outstanding #FocusonForce practice exams.  I do not think I could have handled the pressure of the test without getting that practice in first.\n\nThank you to Christine Marshall for allowing me to test your new study materials and for the amazing #SalesforceBen practice exams!  Those resources were instrumental in helping me to get certified!\n\nLast, but certainly not least, thank you to Bradley Rice and the Talent Stacker | Salesforce Career Development Program for guiding me through this process and exposing me to the amazing #Ohana.  I am filled with so much joy because I became a part of the Salesforce ecosystem and joined this giving, supportive, open-minded, and talented group of people!\n\nWhile this is a great moment, which I plan to soak up, this is only the beginning!  My story is to be continued...\n\n#awesomeadmins #certifiedatlast #salesforceadmin #ohana #talentstacker #alwaysbelearning",

When it comes to job seekers, things are looking most competitive for those in media & communications, arts & design and community & social services roles \u2014 with the number of active job seekers outweighing the number of workers in those functions who believe that new jobs will become available.\n\nFor those with accounting, program & project management and healthcare services roles, however, demand for new jobs is lower than the perceived supply.\n\nDo you relate to these findings?

Middle school is often where we make or break a kid\u2019s future \u2013 and there is so much opportunity and potential during middle school to shape them for the rest of their lives.\n\nAndrew Ravin is the founder and head of school at Workshop Middle School. He\u2019s deeply committed to social change and, for seven years, worked in community social services in both New York and Chicago. In addition, he\u2019s spent more than 15 years working in New York City public schools.\n\nDenise Daniels is the co-founder and director of learning at Workshop Middle School, with more than 22 years of experience in education as a teacher, a staff developer, a curriculum designer, an instructional coach, and a school leader.\n\nWe discuss what Workshop Middle School does differently and how they\u2019re rethinking the classroom structure, from starting later in the day to organizing smaller class sizes. Getting things right for kids at this transitional period in life is so important.\n\nFind this and every episode of the Learning Unboxed podcast on Apple Podcasts or wherever you listen to podcasts.\n\nNow available as Audio, Video, or as a written Transcript\nLearning Unboxed is produced in part by Crate Media\n#thisispast",

Middle school is often where we make or break a kid\u2019s future \u2013 and there is so much opportunity and potential during middle school to shape them for the rest of their lives.\n\nAndrew Ravin is the founder and head of school at Workshop Middle School. He\u2019s deeply committed to social change, and, for seven years, worked in community social services in both New York and Chicago. He\u2019s spent more than 15 years working in New York City public schools.\nDenise Daniels is the co-founder and director of learning at Workshop Middle School, with more than 22 years of experience in education as a teacher, a staff developer, a curriculum designer, an instructional coach, and a school leader.\n\nWe discuss what Workshop Middle School does differently and how they\u2019re rethinking the structure of the classroom, from starting later in the day to organizing smaller class sizes. Getting things right for kids at this transitional period in life is so important.\n\nSubscribe to Learning Unboxed to hear more: https://lnkd.in/eY8n87wD\n\nNow available as Audio, Video, or as a written Transcript\nLearning Unboxed is produced in part by Crate Media\n#thisispast Workshop Middle School PAST Foundation",

The JWST will take another 28 days to reach its final orbit at the 'Lagrange 2' point, about 1.5 million km away from the earth. Actual full scale operations will take longer.\n\nThe JWST is one of the most complex and expensive scientific instruments built by humans. It will help us 'look back' at the earliest objects in the universe, billions of light years away. Its development has taken over 20,000 human years, spanning three decades and has cost over $10 billion.\n\nDo watch this excellent documentary about the 'insane' engineering behind the JWST:\n\n'The Insane Engineering of James Webb Telescope'\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/d8Xc5535 \n\nInsane and incredible! Materials, heat exchange & cooling, cryogenics, optics, mechanics, controls... and a lot more. Almost every branch of engineering/tech involved in this complex mission.\n\nWishing team JWST at NASA, ESA and other countries all the best!\n\nDo follow regular updates via NASA, NASAWebb on twitter.\n\n#JWST #NASA #ESA #JamesWebbSpaceTelescope",

They have gone by so fast yet will leave an indelible imprint on who I am.\n\nThe journey took me from the front line to head office in Croydon where I've helped develop and deliver initiatives that improve our customers' lives.  Now I am spreading my wings and flying the nest, taking all that I have learnt beneath the spangly pink star of Superdrug and applying it to the tech start-up world with Thriva, as a senior partnerships manager.\n\nI have worked with some truly fantastic humans over the years. I hope I have left an impression on them as they have on me. I am grateful for the years that have gone by and relish the years that are to come with the support of the most important people in my life.\n\nThank you #superdrug\nHello #Thriva",

        "content": "\u201cHo 31 anni e continuo a ricevere commenti che mettono in dubbio il mio essere abbastanza adulta per parlare di grappa. Lo trovo umiliante.\u201d\n\nSono passati 125 anni da quando Orazio Nonino tirava la carretta nelle campagne friulane e col suo alambicco distillava gli scarti delle vigne dei padroni.\n\nPotrebbe finire dopo 2 generazioni quando suo nipote Antonio cade in guerra lasciando due figli piccoli, ma sua moglie Silvia non ci sta. Si rimbocca le maniche, diventa la prima mastra distillatrice italiana. \n\nL\u2019impresa va avanti col figlio Benito, ma il destino ha deciso che saranno le donne a fare la differenza a cominciare da sua moglie Giannola.\n\nSar\u00e0 lei a fare di un prodotto dell'economia contadina la Regina dei distillati al pari di maschi alfa come whisky e cognac. Sfider\u00e0 l\u2019usanza di distillare vinacce assemblate a favore del solo Picolit, metter\u00e0 le sue bottiglie in mano ad iconici trendsetters da Gianni Agnelli a Silvana Mangano e far\u00e0 della grappa un fatto culturale col Premio Nonino, nato per recuperare vitigni rari.\n\nPoteva finire alla quarta generazione perch\u00e9 Giannola non avrebbe dovuto avere figli per un problema al cuore. Ne avr\u00e0 invece 3. Tutte femmine. Tutte in azienda con Cristina che avr\u00e0 due femmine e un maschio.\n\nFrancesca \u00e8 la pi\u00f9 piccola. Il peso che deve portare \u00e8 quello di una storia pi\u00f9 grande di lei. L\u2019orgoglio \u00e8 quello di avere la fortuna di volerne e poterne far parte.\n\nA Milano, dove va ad abitare da sola per la prima volta per l\u2019universit\u00e0, prende le misure della vita adulta. Non sar\u00e0 facile scrollarsi di dosso la marca della campagnola che viene dal nulla.\n\nLei lo far\u00e0 con una ricetta che diventer\u00e0 la cifra della sua credibilit\u00e0: essere autentica e studiare continuamente (per ora laurea in economia, sommelier, bartender e master in Social Media Communication).\n\nIn 5 anni di duro lavoro sbarca sui social e col suo volto fresco e vitale riesce a sdoganare la storia di famiglia e la sua grappa ad un pubblico giovane e a superare le limitazioni della pandemia digitalizzando un marketing basato da sempre sull\u2019incontro fisico col pubblico di estimatori.\n\nIn un mondo di urlatori lo far\u00e0 senza megafoni, parlando di colonne di distillazione e danza della grappa ed essendo semplicemente s\u00e9 stessa. Su LinkedIn raccoglie oltre 40.000 followers. La chiamano al decennale a raccontare la sua storia in quella stessa Milano che l\u2019aveva snobbata.\n\nLa ragazza venuta dal Friuli ha 31 anni ed ha tutti i numeri per portare nel terzo millennio la Migliore Distilleria del Mondo, prima italiana a ottenere questo riconoscimento. Lo sta gi\u00e0 facendo.\n\nHa detto Emerson: \u201cQuel che abbiamo alle spalle e quel che abbiamo davanti sono piccole cose se paragonate a ci\u00f2 che abbiamo dentro\u201d",

The principle is simple. Most experiments today are controlled by computers so researchers can access expensive equipment from MIT etc., remotely & conduct experiments to find solutions to local sustainability challenges\n\nThe emerging meta-university, built on the power of the Web & launched by the open courseware movement, will give teachers & learners everywhere the ability to access & share teaching materials, scholarly publications, scientific works in progress, run remote experiments & collaborate worldwide to meet the growing demand for high quality & affordable Higher Education\n\nFlexibility in HigherEd is essential to facilitate multidisciplinary studies so that an MBA Marketing student can take a Credit Course in Psychology, a student of Media & Communications can take a course in Digital Design & Visual Storytelling & an Engineering/Technology student can study Marketing/Finance/Law which are essential\n\nThe benefits are manifold & the possibilities are Infinite with the Meta-University Concept with Technology further adding value - VR/AR enhancing learning experience, #KnowledgePlatforms,  Communication & Collaboration tools facilitating sharing of knowledge & scholarly resources, Flexible New #Payment Models & #DigitalCredentials\n\nWelcome to The University of the Future\u00a0- Meta University\n\nIf the Meta University Concept is to reach its full potential in bridging the worldwide higher education gap fundamental issues related to IP Rights, Quality Control, Digital Divide & Costs need to be addressed",

We hope that this book serves as a primer and benefits anyone who manages software platforms or may be interested in transitioning to product management or program management.\n\nI would like to thank Nazrul Islam, Angela Yee and Saffana Velji for their valuable insights and suggestions & Jillian Rene Smith for excellent copy editing of the book! \n\nI owe my gratitude to Prof. M.P. Narayanan, Prof. Puneet Manchanda and all my teachers and my wonderful cohort at the University of Michigan - Stephen M. Ross School of Business for imparting the knowledge that has enabled me to evaluate software platforms from a strategic lens! Go blue!!\n\nI would love to get your feedback on the book! \n\nHappy holidays! \n\n#productmanagement #productstrategy #platforms #productmamagers #goblue #fighton\nCc: Product League Product School Product People",

The warranty won\u2019t cover the damage, and you didn\u2019t think you\u2019d need AppleCare. You\u2019re out of luck, right? Not if you used the right credit card to make the purchase.\n\nPurchase protection can save you big if a recently bought item is damaged or stolen. A few credit cards may even provide protection if you lose a recently purchased item. Only some credit cards offer purchase protection, though, and the benefits tend to vary across cards. This guide will describe the basics of credit card purchase protection and detail some of the credit cards that offer the best coverage.\n\nGet the latest points, miles and travel news by\u00a0signing up for\u00a0TPG\u2019s free daily newsletter.\n\nIn This Post\n\nWhat is purchase protection?\n\nThe purchase protection benefit offered by select credit cards covers eligible purchases against accidental damage or theft \u2014 and for some cards, loss \u2014 in the first few months after you use an eligible card to pay for the purchase.

Card issuers strive to set their products apart from the competition by offering incentives like welcome bonuses, but sometimes the less flashy benefits can also end up being very valuable.\n\nIn this post, I\u2019ll look at the three different shopping protection policies offered by many American Express cards and explain how you can leverage these benefits to save money.\n\nNew to The Points Guy? Want to learn more about credit card points and miles? Sign up for our daily newsletter.\n\nIn This Post\n\nPurchase protection\n\nPurchase protection will reimburse you for theft or accidental damage to eligible items that occurred within 90 days of purchase. To be eligible, all you have to do is charge a portion of your qualifying purchase to your American Express card \u2014 but you\u2019ll only be reimbursed up to the amount charged to your card.\n\nWith most Amex cards, you\u2019re covered for up to $1,000 per covered incident and up to $50,000 per year, but the reimbursement doesn\u2019t include any shipping or handling expenses. However, certain premium cards cover your purchases for up to $10,000 per incident, with the same limit of up to $50,000 in total claims per calendar year.\n\nCards with this higher level of coverage include:\n\nThe Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express, The Business Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express and all other consumer versions in the Platinum family.\nAmerican Express\u00ae Gold Card.\nDelta SkyMiles\u00ae Reserve American Express Card and the Delta SkyMiles\u00ae Reserve Business American Express Card.\nHilton Honors Aspire Card from American Express.\n\nThe information for the Hilton Aspire Amex card has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.\n\n(Photo by Isabelle Raphael/The Points Guy)\n\nAs with any insurance policy, the devil is always in the details. In this case, you have to purchase an item that\u2019s eligible for coverage and the loss can\u2019t be due to an excluded reason.\n\nWhat\u2019s excluded?\n\nThe following are ineligible for coverage:\n\nUnconditional satisfaction guarantee.\nDamage through altercation or modifications.\nAnimals or living plants.\nOne-of-a-kind items such as rare stamps and coins.\nConsumable or perishable items such as perfume, light bulbs and batteries.\nNegotiable instruments including travelers checks and gift cards.\nItems that are rented, leased or borrowed.\nMotorized vehicles, parts and accessories.\nAnything purchased for resale or commercial use.\nPermanent household items such as carpet, flooring, air conditioners and refrigerators.\nLand or buildings.\nMore than one article in a pair or set.\nDownloadable services.\nItems voluntarily or involuntarily discarded.\nMedical or dental equipment or d...",

The researcher might bias the procedure by looking only for data that would support the hypothesis. Hypotheses have nothing to do with proof. Rather, their acceptance or rejection depends on what the data \u2014 and the data alone \u2014 ultimately reveal.\n\nSource: pp59-60 of \nhttps://lnkd.in/eh57zUPr",

In doing so, we became aware of many challenges associated with production-grade controllers. This article describes one challenge we rarely see discussed: The \u201creal world\u201d can autonomously deviate from the users\u2019 desired state, so it must be watched by controllers just like the Kubernetes API.",

You\u2019ll return to these reasons as motivation during frustrating times. \ud83e\udda0\n------\nFirst, as the owner, I do believe that you\u2019re in control of your financial destiny. If your business performs well, the sky\u2019s the limit regarding what you can earn. You have the potential to earn far more money as an owner than an employee. \n\nAdditionally, as the owner, you\u2019re in charge of every aspect of the business. You decide when you work, what clients you want to take on, and all other aspects. Owning the business offers you far more freedom than working for someone else. \n\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, owning a pest control business allows you to assist people during trying times. After all, when someone has a pest infestation, they need help fast. You can provide that help so folks feel comfortable and safe in their own homes or anywhere where they need your service.\n\n#allandraper #businesscoach #businessmentor #financialfreedom #taketheleap #growthexpert #businesscash #mentorship #startbusiness #growbusiness #newentrepreneur #pestcontrol #pestcontrolbusiness",

I am excited to announce a Free/Voluntary knowledge session series for the CIA Challenge exam beginning this weekend with limited 60 seats (on first cum basis). The sessions will be stretched for 3 weeks and will be mostly done in evening hours on weekdays (from 8 pm to 11 pm) and on the weekends (6 pm to 9 pm). Schedule will be shared separately. \n\nPlease note there will be no recording shared and these will be live sessions. \n\nI am looking for 50% strength with fellow members who have appeared for CIA challenge exam and could not clear in first attempt and balance 50% of fellow members who are 10 + years experienced in the Risk Advisory domain. Sharing the google form for your quick update and registration. \n\nhttps://lnkd.in/ggR6K9fy\n\nThe shortlisted members will receive email for the session series. Thanks for all the appreciation so far on this journey.\nIIA India",

It was obvious to me that I wanted to pursue my master's degree at a university that could inspire me with its city as well as the wisdom and experience of teachers and students from all over the world, and Politecnico di Torino is definitely the place to achieve it .\nI realised that it was not about reaching the end line first but having enjoyed the run.\nOn 16th of December 2021, I graduated from Poltiecnico di Torino with a master's degree in Mechanical Engineering .\nI did my MSc thesis in the field of renewable energy which is going to be considered in the next years for many applications to diminish the global warming ,the title of my thesis is  Numerical optimization of enhanced linear Fresnel collector equipped with Raschig rings porous medium. \nI would like to thank my supportive supervisor Laura Savoldi for her help and guidance throughout the research and special thanks to the PhD student  Mr. Hossein Ebadi  the discussions with him has helped me to overcome difficulties to proceed my thesis.\nAll thanks and appreciation should be given to my best university Politecnico di Torino and Italian government for fully funded scholarship that provided me to pursue my studies.\nAt the end of this journey , I should never forget to thank my cousin Khaled Alamin   for his support during these years. Moreover , my family and friends who always have shown their support. Without them, I would not be able to reach this point. My love and gratefulness to them are beyond any words.\nEventually, I am looking forward to the social and career challenges, my commitment to become a mechanical engineer is very strong and I am certain I can contribute to the society I live in.",

If 2020 was insane, how can I possibly describe 2021?\n\nWhat almost killed us at the beginning of 2020 made us infinitely stronger in 2021. We continued to reinvent ourselves and our ecosystem \u2013 the company itself, our key suppliers, retailers and partners, our team \u2013 blew my mind with their solidarity, creativity and agility, along with an enormous amount of energy.\n\nThe result? Hands down our best year ever.\n\nA few highlights? A dozen product launches including the hyper radical HM9-SV, the celebratory LMX marking 10 years of Legacy Machines, and a disruptive experiment called \u201cM.A.D.1\u201d; the first completions of our new retail identity, visible in Dubai and Bangkok; outstanding auction results including the HM10 Panda for Only Watch, reaching the highest price ever for an MB&F; two awards at the GPHG; an euphoric collaboration with Bulgari; and the unprecedented demand for pieces like the new LM101s which collectors are desperate to get their hands on, despite wait times of over two years.\n\nBottom line, in 2021 we delivered 275 watches to our retailers\u2026 who sold nearly 400 to their final customers. Our best sell-in vs sell-out ratio ever.\n\nMy most heartfelt thanks go to our clients, retailers, partners, suppliers, supporters, the team\u2026 to all of you, our Friends. You make me so happy and so proud.\n\nWe\u2019re ready to rock, 2022!",

        "content": "Boa tarde, amigos!\n\nEscrevo esse post para me despedir e, principalmente agradecer por esse longo per\u00edodo em que estive na FGV|IBRE. Afinal, foram 8 anos de muitas conquistas, desafios, tens\u00f5es criativas, frustra\u00e7\u00f5es, alegrias... Como diria Roberto: \u201cSe chorei ou se sorri, o importante \u00e9 que emo\u00e7\u00f5es eu vivi\u201d.\n\nProjetos? Muitos! Quero citar alguns aqui, n\u00e3o apenas para celebrar as nossas conquistas, mas tamb\u00e9m para relembrar de aprendizados e conhecimento que cada um gerou, e este capital intelectual continua dentro do IBRE, em voc\u00eas, pronto para ser aproveitado.\u00a0\n\n\t     - Na melhoria da qualidade e efici\u00eancia, trabalhamos duro para cocriar o PRICE COLLECTOR, come\u00e7amos a parceria com os amigos da FGV|Emap em 2015, passamos pela parceria com nosso amigo Alberto Cavallo e chegamos em uma base de pre\u00e7os web robusta que nos ajudou a superar as limita\u00e7\u00f5es impostas pelo Covid. Outra conquista? Resolvemos, juntos, o problema de mais de 6 anos do SACV. Thank god, nunca mais ouviu-se falar em SACV.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- Na monetiza\u00e7\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m tivemos contribui\u00e7\u00f5es importantes. Fizemos algumas vers\u00f5es do Smart IBRE, o Simulador CMG, o InteliRec, em parceria com a Saint Gobain e fizemos mudan\u00e7as importantes no Licenciados que este ano crescer\u00e1 a receita em aproximadamente 20%. Acredito tamb\u00e9m muito nos Projetos QUOD|O/F e de Mercado de trabalho, ser\u00e3o um breakthrough nas finan\u00e7as\\impacto do IBRE.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- Ficamos mais tempo focado nos \u201cbens p\u00fablicos\u201d e, por isso, \u00e9 claro, \u00e9 onde temos mais contribui\u00e7\u00f5es. Fizemos o BETS, maior pacote R de base de dados brasileira com mais de 15 mil downloads por m\u00eas e citado internacionalmente. Fizemos o primeiro pacote R de nowcasting do mundo e fomos pioneiros no nowcasting do PIB brasileiro. Criamos o NTF e junto o Portal da Infla\u00e7\u00e3o. Publicamos junto com a Elsevier o livro An\u00e1lise de S\u00e9ries Temporais em R, que j\u00e1 est\u00e1 na quarta tiragem. Tivemos papel relevante na cultura de dados do FGV|IBRE e fomos pioneiros no uso de ferramentas como o RShiny, Python, Git, Mongo, etc. E, claro, n\u00e3o pod\u00edamos esquecer do Indicador de Incerteza da Economia. Citado em mais de 5 atas do Copom \u00e9 o indicador p\u00fablico mais big data e data Science do Brasil.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- Al\u00e9m disso, junto com o FGV|IDE tive o prazer e a honra de cocriar o curso de Big Data e Data Science que foi o maior sucesso. Mais de 600 alunos passaram pelo nosso curso, inclusive, claro, v\u00e1rios amigos do IBRE que coloc\u00e1vamos no curso como \u201couvinte\u201d (rsrs...).\n\nTudo isso, \u00e9 claro, n\u00e3o teria sido poss\u00edvel se n\u00e3o fossem as pessoas e aqui aproveito para agradecer todas elas que trabalharam comigo. Voc\u00eas s\u00e3o demais!!!! Meu muito obrigado!! \n\nAcho que \u00e9 isso. \u00c9 muito dif\u00edcil resumir 8 anos em um post. Quero agradecer a TODXS, sem exce\u00e7\u00e3o, por esses oito anos de conviv\u00eancia. Muitos objetivos foram alcan\u00e7ados, mas, o mais importante, foi muito prazeroso trilhar o caminho junto com voc\u00eas. OBRIGADO, FGV|IBRE!!!\n\nMuit\u00edssimo obrigado e um forte abra\u00e7o,\nPedro",

        "content": "After 5 amazing years, this is my last week with EGYM | North America. \n\nI have learned so much during an incredible journey with EGYM and been given countless opportunities that I will be forever thankful for. I joined EGYM (formerly Netpulse) as a Key Account Manager in 2017. In 2018 I was promoted to Head of Account Management - EMEA. In 2019 I was promoted to Director of Account Services - EMEA and attended The ukactive Future Leaders Programme. In 2020 I started my MBA at Oxford Brookes University. And finally, in 2021 I was promoted to Director of Account Services - North America. As I reflect on my time here, enough cannot be said about EGYM's commitment to developing those with a can-do attitude.\n\nAlso, a special thank you to Dana Milkie for your trust, support, and advice my friend. It was a short but successful ride under your leadership in N.A. that unfortunately came to a halt due to the ongoing pandemic.\n\nNone of the above would have been possible without the support of several other key people (you know who you are) and I cannot speak highly enough of my experiences with EGYM and my awesome colleagues at EGYM | DACH, EGYM | Spain, EGYM | France, EGYM | United Kingdom, EGYM | North America. To past and present colleagues - you will never understand the impact that you had on me personally and the enjoyment that I received from working with you. I do not doubt that 2022 will be the best year yet for EGYM and I wish you all every success personally and professionally.\n\nI would also like to thank every health and fitness operator around the world that I have had the pleasure of collaborating with. I am extremely proud of several projects and achievements. What an epic ride together! In addition to this I would also like to thank our partners across the globe; without you a number of key initiatives wouldn\u2019t have been possible.\n\nAs for my future, I am delighted to be taking on a new challenge with Alex Peacock and the talented team at SweatWorks as Global Client Services Director.\n\nWishing you all a relaxing and happy holiday season and look forward to seeing you in 2022.",

It\u2019s great grounding for a career in inhouse legal and compliance, given the level of regulatory scrutiny banks are under and therefore the strong controls they need.\u00a0\n\nAlso I was able to move around and support different businesses, which kept me learning and growing. Eventually, though, I was bitten by the fintech bug. First it was through working with SC Ventures, Standard Chartered\u2019s fintech accelerator. Then Assembly Payments, one of SC Ventures' companies. And now Currencycloud, a B2B2X cross-border payments specialist.\n\nIn fintech you have to move fast, but you can\u2019t break things. I enjoy the pace and the responsibility to take risk decisions. I also enjoy being part of a tight-knit team all pulling in the same direction.\u00a0\n\nAt Currencycloud, it\u2019s particularly fun to be taking a business that has worked in the West and building it out across APAC.\n\nIf you want to join us, check out our open roles https://bit.ly/3xvjwtu\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019ll be hiring for some compliance roles in APAC next year.\n\n#fintech #crossborderpayments #fx #nottoomanyhashtags #thatwouldbeannoying",

The CFA is not a license to practice finance.\n2. The CFA is just one of many factors that an employer might take into consideration in the hiring process.\n3. Many back office employees take the exams in the hopes that they might advance to the front office, in search of respect and a higher paycheck. Frequently, they don\u2019t.\n4. The biggest cost associated with the decision to become a CFA is time.\n5. On Wall Street, the CFA is held in much higher regard (than the MBA). \n6. The CFA program doesn\u2019t necessarily make you a better investor.\n7. None of the really interesting things that are happening in finance these days, like the study of sentiment and psychology, are covered in any detail by the CFA program.\n8. I honestly don\u2019t remember a single thing I learned from the CFA program. On the other hand, I got a great deal out of my MBA program, which was an immersive experience.\n9. Whether people realize it or not, finance is a profession that requires a lot of creativity. The CFA program beats it out of people.\n10. Often, the benefit is pure credentialism: you get to put the letters \u201cCFA\u201d after your name.\n\nThe below Reddit thread has many comments that show different perspectives. \n\nhttps://lnkd.in/dBaGdtu8\n\nI\u2019m keen to hear from my connections. What\u2019s your experience? What do you think?? \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0e\n\n#cfaprogram #cfaexam #cfainstitute #wallstreet #assetmanagement #equityresearch #qualifications",

Here I ask some questions:\n-If HR can be self-service by the organization, why can supply chain planning be used more broadly by the organization? Why do we depend on 1% of the back office employees averaging two years of tenure to use the technology?\n-Current architectures are very \"model\" or \"engine-centric\". Why are we not more focused on workflow, rules, and policy management?\n-In current architectures, manufacturing, procurement, and transportation operate within silos. How do we drive bi-directional orchestration across source, make and deliver together?\n-With the greater depth of NoSQL, why are we locked into relational data structures?\n-As variability increases, why is there no central repository to help sense and respond to variation in lead times and conversion rates? \n\nAs we build planning outside-in, some of these gaps are easier to close. For more on my thoughts, check out my podcast for the week.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/d-A9NiP",

But what\u2019s strange is  some of institutions distinguish between these two lines in honoring, motivating, and others matters, which are unfair to the right of back line (Back office employees).usually l compare employees with the sport team , in other words, both member\u2019s team practice intensively, each in his position ,So when the team wins a championship all members getting a same award ,honor, and fame. Although the market value differ from player (employee)to another according to his/her position and skills. Whereas every employee performs his/her duties to the fullest , he or she is entitled to receive a same honor and motivation as the front line employees members, taking in consideration a small variations .\n \nThe disparity between employees negatively impact in working environment , and increase the gap between staff members ,as well as between employees and management , and It could be a reason for the talented employees to leave the ORG and also to create an unhealthy work environment.\n\nShare your point of view \ud83d\udc42\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc42\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc42\ud83c\udffb",

        "content": "\"The CFA exams were created in 1963 as a way to establish standards of proficiency in securities analysis. If you pass all three levels and earn the CFA charter, you are assumed to know things about accounting, financial statements, derivatives and portfolio theory. No such standard existed prior to the CFA, and the securities industry lacked a professional designation like the CPA, which those in the accounting profession need to practice their craft. But the CFA is not a licensure exam. CFAs and non-CFAs alike work in investment banking, investment research and trading. There is a licensure exam in finance, and it\u2019s called the Series 7, but it\u2019s not too difficult.\"\n\n\"So if the CFA is not a license to practice finance, what is it? Many take the exams to get ahead in their careers, thinking that the CFA designation might earn them a promotion or a better-paying job. In reality, the CFA is just one of many factors that an employer might take into consideration in the hiring process. I have encountered many low-level finance workers and back office employees who take the exams in the hopes that they might advance to the front office, in search of respect and a higher paycheck. Frequently, they don\u2019t.\"\n\n\"The biggest cost associated with the decision to become a CFA is time. The CFA doesn\u2019t cost much in the way of actual dollars, just a few thousand for the entire course of study. But it takes up an enormous amount of time consisting of many hundreds and even thousands of hours of studying for each level. And that\u2019s if they pass all three exams on the first try, which only about 20% of people do. For the other 80%, it\u2019s a commitment of four or five years, and sometimes longer. I have several friends who, once they began the CFA program, seemingly disappeared, not to be seen for three years.\u201d\n\n\"I realized when I was studying for the exams that I wasn\u2019t really learning the material; I was just learning how to pass a test. I honestly don\u2019t remember a single thing I learned from the CFA program. On the other hand, I got a great deal out of my MBA program, which was an immersive experience, with in-person classes, guest lectures and study groups. My MBA is still paying dividends. The CFA Institute has, whether intentionally or not, euthanized the MBA. On Wall Street, the CFA is held in much higher regard, which is too bad because the MBA degree (or other graduate programs) produce more well-rounded and thoughtful employees.\"\n\n\"My biggest criticism of the CFA program is that it doesn\u2019t necessarily make you a better investor. If there were concrete evidence that funds managed by CFA charterholders outperformed those of non-CFAs, that would be a compelling reason to take the test. But there is none \u2014it\u2019s all theater. And none of the really interesting things that are happening in finance these days, like the study of sentiment and psychology, are covered in any detail by the CFA program.\"\n______\n#investing #finance",

Constantly waking up to silence or rejection emails. You tell yourself, \"Maybe if my grades were higher, maybe if I had cooler experiences, maybe if I...\" Some of us didn't get high grades during our first year because it was difficult to acclimate to law school as a first-generation student. Some of us entered into law school thinking that we had to limit ourselves to a certain sector of law due to our ethnic background. Some of us may have wanted to explore different practice areas of the law too late in the summer hiring process, and now you feel as if opportunities are scarce. Some of us have questioned if law school is the path for us with all the no's that we have been getting lately. These are all scenarios that I have definitely identified with. \n\nHowever, I'm writing this to encourage others (even myself) and let you know that you're not alone. I hope that you land the job that you truly desire because you are worthy of it! We are doing our best to balance school, extracurriculars, and our personal lives during a pandemic. Rejection will happen, but nothing that is meant for your life will pass you by. \n\n#firstgeneration #lawstudent",

        "content": "This is the post I've been waiting to make for what feels like FOREVER!  I have watched so many amazing and talented members of the #Ohana start (or continue) their journeys as Salesforce Professionals and now I am ECSTATIC to share that I've joined the ranks: I am a Salesforce CERTIFIED Administrator!\n\nIn January 2021, I took the Five-Day Challenge from #TalentStacker and decided that Salesforce wasn't for me.  I did not believe that I could transition from a successful career as a teacher to someone who works in tech.  I left my teaching job in May and ventured into the unknown.  I continued to teach online classes, which were amazing and I loved keeping that connection to my students and to a field I love.  Because of some changes to the online ESL teaching company I worked for, I realized that I needed to figure out my next steps quicker than I had planned.  \n\nFast forward to the end of August, my husband and I were enjoying a nice walk and we started talking about #FinancialIndependence, #ChooseFI, and then #Salesforce.  In the span of a few conversations, my husband convinced me that I did have \"what it takes\" and my skills as a teacher would be transferable to anything new I tried.  He continued to push me and believe in me, which ultimately led me to this day.  I could not be happier to be a Salesforce Certified Administrator.  \n\nThere are so many people to thank because no one EVER does anything alone.  First, (and you might have guessed this one), thank you to my wonderful and supportive husband, Noah Farber-Jones.  If he hadn't continued to send #Salesforce and #Talentstacker information my way, I would not be sharing this post today.\n\nThank you to my amazing study mates, Angie Tinio and Kathy Umanzor, who kept me focused on my studying goals and made learning Salesforce even more fun!  I cannot wait to hear their success stories in the very near future!\n\nThank you to Caitlin Nguyen for your amazing videos on Trailhead Live that taught me about data analytics, permission sets, and validation rules!  \n\nThank you to Martin Gessner for the outstanding #FocusonForce practice exams.  I do not think I could have handled the pressure of the test without getting that practice in first.\n\nThank you to Christine Marshall for allowing me to test your new study materials and for the amazing #SalesforceBen practice exams!  Those resources were instrumental in helping me to get certified!\n\nLast, but certainly not least, thank you to Bradley Rice and the Talent Stacker | Salesforce Career Development Program for guiding me through this process and exposing me to the amazing #Ohana.  I am filled with so much joy because I became a part of the Salesforce ecosystem and joined this giving, supportive, open-minded, and talented group of people!\n\nWhile this is a great moment, which I plan to soak up, this is only the beginning!  My story is to be continued...\n\n#awesomeadmins #certifiedatlast #salesforceadmin #ohana #talentstacker #alwaysbelearning",

As today I returned my equipment I can now say that after 10 years and 5 months I said goodbye to the fantastic people that work at Pearson IOKI Sp. z o.o. and Pearson English. I joined IOKI back in 2011 for (what I thought) a short time, just to digitise some activities and get myself new shoes. I ended working for many years with truly amazing people, first as a Content Development Specialist and finally as a manager for the whole Pozna\u0144 team. I am so grateful for everything I learned, for every meeting I had, for every good word I was told, for every coffee we had together. It is truly the team that makes the company successful. Thank you everyone for this experience, especially my fellow Senior Managers and the whole Content Team from Pozna\u0144. I am certain I have made friends for life.\n\nNow off to new adventures!",

        "content": "Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen Falsely Advertises Build Back Better in Memo to Senate. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is carrying out a desperate, last-ditch effort to sell the increasingly unpopular Build Back Better Act before the year ends.\u00a0\n\nYellen sent a memo to the Senate Dec. 9 titled \u201cFiscal Responsibility and the Build Back Better Act.\u201d She wanted to get ahead of major reports that delivered a one-two punch to the Democrats\u2019 plan to increase taxes and dole it back out to friends of the party.\n\nDespite repeated assertions of the bill being paid for, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released a report showing that the temporary policies in the bill would increase deficit spending by $3 trillion. On top of that, inflation is hitting a 40-year high as consumer prices continue to rise because of out-of-control government spending.\n\nAs the Biden administration finds itself unable to escape the real economic consequences of its left-wing policies, Yellen in her memo swings blind with claims that are far removed from reality. Here are the following claims Yellen makes about the Build Back Better Act.\n\nClaim 1: The Build Back Better Act is fully paid for in the first decade.\n\nFact Check: FALSE\u2014The Congressional Budget Office shows that the Build Back Better Act is NOT fully paid for and will increase the deficit by nearly $400 billion.\n\nYellen states in her memo that the Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation support her claim that the Build Back Better Act would reduce deficits by $100 billion in the first decade.\n\nHowever, the memo links to an older report that outright refutes that claim and estimates the bill will increase the deficit by $367 billion over 10 years. Even if potentially higher revenues that could result from additional IRS administrative funding is included (the White House-Congressional scorekeeping guidelines exclude these types of revenues because they are highly speculative), the bill would still increase deficits by $160 billion.\n\nYellen is basing her claim on her own Treasury Department\u2019s unrealistic assumption that IRS funding would yield more than double the revenues projected by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. A nonpartisan independent analysis has rejected the Treasury Department\u2019s biased numbers.\n\nFurthermore, the Congressional Budget Office with the Joint Committee of Taxation, reports that the Build Back Better Act\u2014without the smoke and mirrors of sunsetting new spending programs\u2014would increase the deficit by $3 trillion over the first 10 years of its enactment.\n\nClaim: The Build Back Better Act is a fully offset decade-long investment that will not add to near-term inflationary pressures.\n\nFact Check: FALSE\u2014Americans are already experiencing inflationary pressures from previous deficit spending. The Build Back Better Act will only worsen existing inflationary pressures.",

One small delight of pub quizzes is thinking of a hilarious team name, then giggling dementedly each time the scorekeeper is forced to repeat it. In case you need it this weekend/half-term, here is a Yorkshire Post list of the 60 funniest pub quiz team names for use during lockdown.

Mattel came to HookBang to develop an innovative solution to help Scrabble players understand the rules and complexities of the game and to help bridge the gap between beginning players and Scrabble veterans. Our team developed a companion app called Scrabble\u00ae Vision: Scorekeeper+. The mobile app was built using custom machine vision algorithms trained to recognize multiple Scrabble boards and their corresponding tile sets. The robust algorithms leverage a mobile phone\u2019s camera system to detect correctly played words, and provide accurate and updated scoring. This has dramatically improved the player experience by streamlining the traditionally cumbersome process of manual scoring. HookBang also built an AI hint system, which is capable of scanning a player\u2019s tile rack, and providing the best hints from a variety of categories.  (Current app release is for Australia only) Check out the demo video below courtesy of our friends at Mattel Games. #augmentedreality #ar #computervision",

It goes up when you win, and down when you lose. It\u2019s that simple.\n\nFar from simple is the fact that you\u2019re up against some of the sharpest minds in the world. There\u2019s always someone who\u2019s better than you, but that\u2019s OK. You don\u2019t have to be the best trader to make money. But you need to be better than the average trader, and\u00a0YOU MUST SURVIVE\u00a0and not blow up your account. That\u2019s the most important thing.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t bet, you can\u2019t win. If you lose all your chips, you can\u2019t bet.\u201d (Larry Hite)\n\nPersonally, to survive the many ups and downs of the markets I need a good game plan \u2013 a plan that\u2019s based on data and rules. And experience. That's because game plans are unlikely to work without experience.\n\nIt\u2019s akin to a cookbook. All the rules are there, so it should work, but somehow the Paella tastes better when it\u2019s prepared by my grandma.\n\nEverything is easy when you know how to do it. Reaching that point and gaining experience along the way is hard, however. You can\u2019t get there by trading in simulation-mode. It only works with real money and it\u2019s an endless journey of learning.\n\nWhat follows are some experiences of my own in our latest Two Quants blog post. Just a few, not all. Some \u201cevergreen\u201d observations of a quant-driven trader. \n\n#trading #markets",

        "content": "Biden's speech tonight will be the most important speech of his life.  \n\nTonight, Tuesday December 21st, 2021 President Joe Biden will speak about the ongoing virus and how to deal with it.  The runaway Omicron variant has exploded, and a country immersed in fear and frustration needs to know who is leading the effort and what is happening to make it all go away.  \nTo date, the clumsily mustered efforts by public health officials and politicians is a 'whack-a-mole' strategy of lock downs, lockouts and mask mandates.  The ebb and flow of the virus seems to have caught the Biden Harris administration off guard - or so says Kamala Harris.  Dr Fauci has become a symbol of all that is wrong with the effort - public appearances sharing no new answers and contradictions of past predictions.  Isn't Fauci supposed to have the answers?  Isn't that what he is paid for?  Yet his job seems to be no more than scorekeeper for a blundering bureaucratic effort.  \nIf Biden blows it tonight he is finished.  Hot off the heals of a failed BBB spending defeat and a litany of immigration problems and failed foreign policy matters has got the stock market spooked and the American people left scratching their heads.  Biden needs a win to save his legacy and I have the gut wrenching feeling he is gonna swing for the bleachers and whiff.  \nI hope and pray that his speech leaves us a bit more optimistic and hopeful.  That he reassures us that all will be okay.  But if he swings between whispers and yelling and mispronouncing words he will leave us wanting for more.  He needs to give answers!  He needs to restore faith!  He needs to be strong!  We will find out tonight is he is, or can do, any of those things.\n#stockmarket #job #people #strategy #publichealth #administration",

His extensive business experience will be key to creating jobs and rebuilding our economy. He\u2019ll also be a strong voice for what rural and small-town communities need to succeed.\n \nMinister Garneau becomes Minister of Foreign Affairs. From leading Canada\u2019s efforts on the Safer Skies Initiative to his work on the Canada-US Relations Cabinet Committee, Marc will bring a great deal of experience to his new portfolio. \n \nParliamentary Secretary Alghabra becomes Minister of Transport. With an engineering background and a history of advocating for public transit in the GTA, I know Omar will do an outstanding job in this new role. \n \nFinally, in addition to serving as Special Representative for the Prairies, Jim Carr will be returning to the Cabinet table where he\u2019ll continue to be a strong advocate for people in the Prairies. \n \nFor more on today\u2019s Cabinet shuffle, click here:",

Pakistan was also the first country to deploy female engagement teams to Congo on June 19, 2019.\n\nApart from two female engagement teams in Congo, a third team would commence operations from March in the Central African Republic.\n\nSo far, around 450 women peacekeepers from Pakistan have served in UN missions.\n\nThe women peacekeepers from Pakistan have won numerous accolades, including tributes at the UN and medals for exceptional performances and services rendered.\n\nIn 2019, Major Samia Rehman was awarded a certificate of appreciation by the special representative of UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres \u2013 who is due in the country on a historic visit commencing on February 16.\n\nSource : https://lnkd.in/es_nUhk",

It was a good 24-year plus run with Crain's in Detroit and Chicago, and I left a lot of good friends. journalists and sources when we moved to hometown of Sarasota in late May. Going forward I may do some spot freelance stories and maybe award stories or profiles, but my two interviews with self-labeled problem gamblers that forms the basis of this sports betting story, is my last story as a staffer. Besides swimming, golfing, tennis (and applying CDB cream and hot tubs for muscle recovery!), I'll still be writing, so anyone who wants to contact me with projects, give me a holler and we can talk.\nHappy holidays for all and like I always used to sign off on my emails, Be Healthy!",

Here's an explanation of this investing strategy.\n\nWhat is Stagflation?\nRecession-inflation is another term for Stagflation. This is a period of growing high inflation, high unemployment rates, and a sluggish economy. The phrase \"stagflation\" was originally used in the 1960s by a UK politician to represent the combination of employment stagnation and price inflation.\n\nHistorically, increasing inflation and high unemployment have had a detrimental influence on economic growth in major economies, which has harmed investors. Stagflation occurs when people earn less while spending more on items and services that have increased due to excessive inflation.\n\nWhat is Stagflation investing?\nStagflation investing is a strategy used by investors to protect their portfolios against high inflation and low unemployment hazards.\nDuring the Stagflation of the 1970s, investors quickly understood that relying only on US stocks would not allow them to handle inflation concerns. As a result, investors realized the need to diversify their investment portfolios.\n\nWhat stocks should I invest in during a stagflation period?\nValue stocks, which are characterized by higher current cash flows, have historically thrived in high-inflation settings, making them ideal equities to purchase during Stagflation. Value stocks include AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), PulteGroup (NYSE: PHM), and NRG Energy (NYSE: NRG).\n\nIdentify high-performing stocks during a period of Stagflation\nEvery country, and every business, was affected differently by the pandemic. Retail, media, and healthcare were all put under a lot of stress during the health emergency. Meanwhile, as consumers turned to technology for pleasure and to help them work remotely, sales of tech giants Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) soared.\n\nDuring times of stagflation, investors should conduct risk assessments on their holdings to stay ahead of the curve. You should be able to weather the storm if you invest in a diverse mix of growth and value stocks.\n#investing \nRemember that these times may also be an excellent time to acquire growth stocks at a bargain price, while your value stock can help you get through periods of Stagflation.",

That is the biggest debate among people, with offices opening up all around the world.\n\nSome would prefer to continue working from the comfort of their home, while some can't wait to get back to the physical office.\n\nWith advantages like better work-life balance and increased productivity, there are also disadvantages like decreased focus and frequent burnouts.\n\nWhile opinions might vary about the best way of working, the pandemic has certainly proved that remote working is more than just a fleeting work culture. It is a new and somewhat improved way of working for most people.\n\nWhat are your opinions on this?\n\n#remoteworking #officeworking #workculture #pandemic #productivity #workfromhome #olivecloud #olivecloudtech",

        "content": "Glad to inform you all that we are moving to our own office, on this auspicious occasion of Navratri. Own office is like a dream come true for me and team. That too, in less than three years of starting the consultancy.\nDoes it make economic sense? Not sure. But nothing can be fancier than having your own office. We weren\u2019t thinking of own office initially. We went for a co-working space. It was easy and quick. But it had its share of problems. There was no parking space available. We as a team opted for a closed room of our own. But any addition to the team had issues. Since a bigger room was not available, the new person had to sit in a remote place, away from the team, till a bigger room was found. \nWhile we were grappling with these issues, Covid 19 hit the world. So started the work from home. Initially, I was very happy. No waste of time in traveling to office and no business travel. But the reality started dawning on us soon. No discipline and no control on working hours, in either direction. With all the family members doing online classes, I was their IT guy, admn person, courier boy, pantry boy and spare resource available for free use. I could get to my work when all these roles were completed, and had to sit till late evening as I started late (well, started early but not MY office work).\nPost lock-down, the co-working places were closed. We looked for a rented office. There were no plug-n-play offices in our preferred location. Lot of money was required for interior which would warrant a longer stay in that place. But longer stay depends on various factors.\nAfter experiencing all options, we finally settled for our own office. Of course, all those issues with various options always have a solution (not sure of issues with work from home, though). But own office gives a sense of stability and achievement. Let\u2019s hope that this is a new beginning for a bigger growth. Seeking your best wishes, as always.\nHappy Navratri.\nVenkataKrishna N Nitin R. Rituraj Bhattacharjee",

        "content": "Back in 2015 I started my research for a MBA program. When I finished my short-list, Stockholm School of Economics was on top of it. In October 2015 I flew to Stockholm to visit the SSE MBA open-house event where I had a 30min chat with the advisor and admission team. 30minutes that should change my life. I realized quickly that this is next step in my development path I have to take. Back home in Austria I wrote down \"SSE Executive MBA\" on a Post-it note to put in my bedroom and one to put on my desk at work. So I saw it daily when I got up (or went to bed) and when I was in the office working. I visualized my next big goal. I focused on my next big goal. I dreamed about my next big goal. For 3 years...\nThree years later I felt ready and applied. It all worked out and the admission board accepted my application and I had my first program week in January 2019.\u00a0\n\nThat road led me out of my comfort zone from day one. A road that forced me to re-prioritize my whole life to make room for 20h/week on-top studying & exams beside my full-time job, which I started as a newbie in Jan/2019. A new job, MBA abroad, no vacation for 2 yrs, limited time for family/friends/sports and yourself. A challenge I was afraid of. Sure, life is good in the comfort zone but outside is where the magic happens they said. And it's true. During this two hypergrowth years I met so many amazing people, learned so much within the variouse moduls - and most important - about MYSELF.\n\nThis story simply shows that if you want to achieve something, work for it. Put in all the hard work, sleepless nights, frustration, happiness, fear, laughter, the aha moments,... Don't wait for something to happen, make it happen. No one will do it for you. Life is too short to wait. Don't expect life to always be easy. Stop talking, start doing. Meet the people you want to meet. Move your body to support your lifestyle. Communicate what you think and feel. Invest in yourself. Leave toxic stuff behind. Don't settle, aim for more. YOUR ONLY LIMIT IS YOU!\n\nA couple of weeks ago I finally had the chance to travel to Stockholm and attend my MBA graduation ceremony. Due to Covid19 we had to wait almost one year to finish this important chapter! We gathered and had an amazing night where we shared stories about the past, the current and the future. I was honored to give a small commencement speech in front of the cohort. A once in a lifetime opportunity I enjoyed very much. Words cannot describe what this MBA was for me, for us. I just can say that you shouldn't wait for something to happen. Go and get it!\u00a0\nI want to thank Stockholm School of Economics faculty and all participants in the SSE MBA cohort of 2019 for this amazing journey.\u00a0\n\n#SSEMBA\nThanks to Karin Wistrom Johan Berglund Ann-Kristin Bjurstr\u00f6m Eija Sarikka for the support and guidance during this 18+ months including a pandemic situation no one ever experienced before. With an immediate switch to hybrid teaching solution we were able to finish",

        "content": "On Dec 2, I officially retired!!!\n\nAfter 30+ years in public education, I put down my chalk.  I loved teaching, and being a site principal, and had an absolute blast being a Chief Business Officer for 14+ years.  I worked in many school districts, and experienced both great leadership and not so great leadership, and I learned from both.  \n\nThanks to all the many mentors, guides, advisors, and the many relationships, both professional and personal, I have developed. \n\nA few standouts: \n...Nancy G - my first teaching position after a 5-minute interview\n...Courtney P - my teaching partner....I love me some Ms. Harley Davidson\n...Judy B - gave me strength to be me\n...Kitty M - provided encouragement and confidence in my growth\n...Nancy F - a great friend and supported my goals\n...Sonny D - my first AP job, my first Principal job and my first CBO job - I owe my career to you\n...Maggie O - I've spent 22 years asking myself, \"what would Maggie O do?\"  You were the best boss!\n...Edwina S - your counsel was unbeatable\n...Deanna G - from our first meeting, best friends and never ending support\n...Stacie J - helping a first year principal survive\n...Suzanne H - what a joy to learn from your patience and stability\n...Liz G - the ability to laugh and keep going\n...RT/JF/SG/LF/CY-DTA - you can work and work hard, and still have fun\n...BA/SL/SD - my compadres through a very dark time\n...Terena M - taking a chance on seasoned candidate and ignoring rumors\n...SMCSD - perspective and the real purpose of education and teaching the whole child, and providing growth opportunities for this white privileged male.\n\nMy one regret was that I was not 'out' when I was teaching and a site principal. Colleagues and some parents knew, but I was never honest when it came to the kids.  Back then...1991...1998...2002...it was a different time.  I encourage all LGBTQIA2+ folks to be honest about your lives.  I was not strong enough to do it, to be a role model for that struggling student, to show it can get better, and I regret that.  2021 is a different world, building on the shoulders of previous generations.  \n\nMy one piece of advice: your job does not care about you.  They will replace you in a heartbeat.  My last job, due to extenuating circumstances, I was working 70-80 hours a week, every week for months.   My last day in the office, I left the office mid morning.  By lunchtime, my replacement had thrown my office desk in the trash.  \n\nShould you work hard?  Of course!  Hard work is good for the soul.  Overworking?  No!  Your job does not care how hard you work and the number of hours you work, but your family sure does.  Those days/events/moments will never come again and your family will never forget you weren't there, but they will remember you were in the office working.  It is time that can never be regained.\n\nNow it is time to spend the next 30 years finding new passions with my husband at my side, and exploring a new world of adventures without an alarm clock.  ;)",

I look forward to working with the team there and learning more about how we can support all of our military service members, active, reserve, and retired. This new position will mean stepping away from a decade of retired pay knowledge, which was a very difficult decision. But it will put my skills to the test in ways that will challenge me and help me grow professionally.\n\nI will always carry with me the retirees who have given at least 20 years of their life in service to this Country, or those who retired due to the physical sacrifices they made. They are not forgotten, and I will never forget them or their families as I continue in my public service career. I also hope to keep the friendships made working with so many talented people in Retired and Annuitant Pay.",

Un d\u00e9but de parcours qui donne un aper\u00e7u sur une carri\u00e8re brillante. \n\nJe d\u00e9bute en 2015 \u00e0 la CRTV Cameroon Radio Television Littoral pendant mon ann\u00e9e de DUT en R\u00e9seaux et T\u00e9l\u00e9communications \u00e0 l'IUT DOUALA de Douala qui m\u2019a propos\u00e9 \u00e0 la CRTV. L\u00e0-bas je participe \u00e0 l'enregistrement des \u00e9missions radio \u00e0 la cabine technique, je m'assurai que les \u00e9missions sont bien enregistr\u00e9es et bien transmises. Mon instrument de travail c'\u00e9tait une console de mixage audio num\u00e9rique. J'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 marqu\u00e9e par les enregistrements des \u00e9missions en direct, c'\u00e9tait autant stressant qu'excitant.\n\nEn 2016, je suis en licence, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une recommandation, j'obtiens un stage acad\u00e9mique chez Matrix T\u00e9l\u00e9coms S A \u00e0 Douala, ou je passe 3 mois \u00e0 configurer des routeurs Microtik, et \u00e0 assister les clients dans la r\u00e9solution de probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s \u00e0 internet. Dans la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, j'int\u00e8gre l'\u00e9quipe INTELCIA o\u00f9 je passe plus de 1 an en tant que conseill\u00e8re technique. J'ai eu le plaisir d'assister par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone des clients qui rencontraient des probl\u00e8mes avec les technologies ADSL et Fibre qui leur donnent acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la TOIP, VOIP, TVIP, Data. J'ai d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 le gout du travail bien fait car l'un des plus grands d\u00e9fis \u00e9tait de garantir la satisfaction client. Pour \u00eatre parmi les meilleurs et obtenir la prime quasi tous les mois, j'ai d\u00fb maitriser et manipuler plusieurs outils, apprendre \u00e0 comprendre et \u00e0 g\u00e9rer les \u00e9motions, ainsi que les conflits, \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 j'ai obtenu ma licence.\n\n2 ans apr\u00e8s en 2018, je rejoins l'\u00e9quipe Philjohn Technologies gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 ma participation \u00e0 un \u00e9v\u00e9nement en tant qu'h\u00f4tesse. J'ai eu l'occasion de m'entretenir avec les administrateurs qui ils m'ont donn\u00e9 ma chance. Pendant 7 mois, j'ai assur\u00e9 le poste de IT Officer Junior Manager en tant que stagiaire, dans une \u00e9quipe de jeunes dynamiques. L\u00e0-bas j'ai administr\u00e9 le syst\u00e8me d'information, assur\u00e9 la maintenance pr\u00e9ventive et curative mat\u00e9rielle et logicielle, j'ai \u00e9galement eu l'occasion de participer \u00e0 un Survey tr\u00e8s enrichissant. Cette ann\u00e9e-l\u00e0, j'obtiens mon master I en R\u00e9seaux et T\u00e9l\u00e9coms \u00e0 l'ENSET de Douala.\n\nMon stage s'\u00e9tant achev\u00e9, en attendant la prochaine rentr\u00e9e, j'ai essay\u00e9 de retrouver \u00e0 nouveau un stage mais en vain. Je d\u00e9cide donc de me lancer dans une activit\u00e9 de vente en ligne des sous-v\u00eatements hommes et la lingerie pour femme\u00a0: l\u2019e-commerce. Pour vendre et me faire de l'argent, j'ai mis en place une strat\u00e9gie apr\u00e8s avoir bien d\u00e9fini mon business. De mani\u00e8re autodidacte je cr\u00e9e, je configure et administre des pages professionnels sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux https://bit.ly/3EclHUA (La boutique de Pascale).\n\nDu r\u00e9seau au Marketing et la communication, je vous livrerai tout de mon parcours, dans un autre post . En attendant, je vous souhaite excellente semaine.\n\n#opentowork #marketingsurlesmdiassociaux #marketingdigital #redactionweb",

At this point she was everyone\u2019s PA!\n\nInside and outside of work, Sadie Davies will always make you smile, make you laugh, and has a great way of influencing you into having that shot at the bar for bants! She will also always have your back & be there no matter what, when you need that help most. \n\nShe\u2019s a star and genuinely worth every single ounce of her weight in gold.

I would like to thank my family for their unwavering support and colleagues who have contributed to my development with support, education, challenge, counsel and setting the right example.  \n\nMy main learnings during this time have been the importance of being your authentic self, that the start point of all decisions is the customer and that, over the course of a career, you should aim to give more than you receive.\n\nHSBC is a great company and the opportunities it offers employees who are prepared to strive to give their best are limitless.  I have been very proud to work for HSBC for this period and will continue to contribute as a Non Executive Director and Advisor.\n\nThanks again to all who have helped me along the way.",

I am very grateful to Barclays for the opportunities it has given me, and I am proud of forming and leading the Barclays Travel and Professional Sports Teams for all these years. A dream role for me with my passion for travel and sport. I never dreamt on my first day that I would have visited over 80 countries or watched a football match at all 92 league grounds.\n2 of my clients who own different large travel companies reminded me last week that they were 29 and 30 years old respectively when I first won their business and became their bank manager. Now 18 years on they are 47 and 48 without them ever having to get a new manager- until now!\nI have made a host of friends for life. Thank you to my network for all your support and help on my journey. I look forward to catching up with many of you over the Summer and beyond.",

        "content": "I observe Shabbat. I have tried to hide at different times but never compromised and it makes me a better lawyer, father, husband, and human. For 26 hours beginning sundown on Friday I turn off my phone and computer, I don\u2019t use electronics and I don\u2019t drive. \n\nWhat I do is affirmatively focus on self-growth. I lean in and nurture my relationship with my kids and beautiful wife. I let my mind rest and allow it to grapple with the challenges of the week in a more creative and innovative way than when I\u2019m in the trenches. I let my perspective zoom out and think about big-picture issues and even do a bit of naval-gazing philosophizing with family and friends.\n\nMost importantly, I evaluate whether I was the kind of lawyer, co-worker, father, and husband that I wanted to be this past week and how I can do better this coming week. \n\nThroughout my career I was told that to do M&A (especially PE), I would have to compromise my Shabbat observance. A partner told me last year, \u201cyou may be the best attorney in the world, but unfortunately, if we get an LOI on Friday night, I need you to turn it back to the client by Saturday night. If you can\u2019t do that, I just can\u2019t work with you. Have you considered Tax?\u201d While I would have loved to work with that person, I am not willing to compromise Shabbat. \n\nShabbat is designed to reinforce that our value is not the sum of our productivity or what we produce. Our value goes beyond our work and beyond the economic value we create. When all the ringing and pinging is gone for 26 hours, you realize that your worth is independent of your work. \n\nJoe Lieberman was an early role model of mine, in part because he observed Shabbat. He was a U.S. Senator and did not compromise Shabbat observance. Not only did he make it work, but it made him a better Senator, a better father, and a better human. He wrote a beautiful book about Shabbat and how everyone (of all faiths or no faith) can benefit by integrating Shabbat into their daily lives by taking moments to self-reflect and discuss deep topics (The Gift of Rest). We had an enjoyable discussion about Shabbat when we met a \u201cfew\u201d years ago (picture in the Comments). \n\nAs we celebrate the holidays with friends and family and move into a new year, we would be well served to integrate a bit of Shabbat into our own lives, to take time to shut off the electronics and be present with our loved ones. These are the moments that have real meaning, these are the moments our children and spouses remember; I would not trade those moments for anything.\n\nWhile I recognize that Shabbat observance could result in a detriment to my career or winning certain clients, the gains to my mental health, peace of mind, creativity, innovation, closeness to family, and overall wellbeing are absolutely priceless. \n\nTo those that celebrate Christmas, wishing you a truly meaningful and peaceful holiday with your loved ones. \n\nShabbat shalom to all.\n\n#privateequity #law #shabbatshalom",

        "content": "How long does it take to be a chief ETO in a cruise ship? Which are the different positions of ETO?\n\nIt depends on a lot of factors like company policy, size of ships, attrition rate, competence, people\u2019s skills, nationality etc. On a small cruise ship / yacht maybe there are 2 ETOs and 3\u20134 assistants, while the biggest class (Oasis) of cruise ship in the world has a compliment of 12 ETOs, 3 Electronic Engineers and 15 assistants. There\u2019s a high probability that if you don\u2019t have the necessary credentials or are unwilling for promotion then you may remain in the same rank throughout your career. Many people do that. It\u2019s difficult to say how many years but 7\u201315 years would be a good guess. It may be faster on a small cruise ship.\nThe various positions are : Chief / Staff ETO, Electronic Engineer, 1st ETO, 2nd / 3rd ETO, 4th ETO (optional), ETO cadet (optional). Then you have Electrical assistants who also have a rank structure like 1st / 2nd / 3rd Electrical assistants. Different companies may have different setups.",

What about the disrespect we show for these administrative/management assistant colleagues? If it was stupid, why not automate it then? The answer is...just because someone doesn't like it, doesn't mean it's stupid. And you can't automate it as you need a human being behind, who thinks, feels, and take decisions.\n\nI say: People who like this kind of work, who want to develop themselves, work in a happy, respectful, and trustful environment, and want to work shoulder to shoulder with the management team of our organization, come to us and kick off the next phase of your career.\u00a0\n\nApply here: https://lnkd.in/eGa7jji",

I am honored to have started my career at a place that values their employees like JCI does, and it has been awesome to see the business grow as an industry leader. \n\u00a0\nThere are so many people to thank, from the technicians in the field to the program and project managers, support specialists, and operational leaders. Your support over the years has been unwavering and greatly appreciated. \n\u00a0\nSpecial thanks to Jason Rabbino, John Gaydos, and Larry O'Steen for taking a chance on a \"green\" college graduate, to Tim Kowtko and Jeff Walleck for their constant mentorship and encouragement, and to Jason Cotaling and Garrett Golubin for their strong partnership and friendship. \n\u00a0\nOver the last decade, I have been exposed to a wide range of opportunities as the business has evolved and the role has changed. But, one thing has remained a constant. Being able to wake up every day with the ability to serve customers and help them achieve their vision and goals is what brings me the most professional enjoyment. I am beyond grateful for the commitment and loyalty that our customers have shown us over the years.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMy wife Nikki Edson Farha and I plan to spend the next six months on a sabbatical, traveling in Asia and enjoying some R&R before embarking on the next stage of our lives. We plan to relocate to the Phoenix, Arizona market in mid-2022, and we are eager to start a new chapter in the southwest. \n\u00a0\nI look forward to the upcoming adventure and next professional challenge. \n\u00a0\nHappy Holidays!\n\u00a0\nCheers,\nEvan",

It's a project, and a year, I'm really quite proud of.\n\n& as always...\n\nThank you to all of my connections, followers, & community for getting me here. It means the world to me to have the support of LinkedIn and the many amazing, talented, generous souls on this platform. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n\nBeing able to express myself and grow a business here has been a God-send to say the least. \n\nThank you LinkedIn, for raising me right. \n\nThank you for being my family. \n\nMay this season bring you joy, connection, and happy memories to last a lifetime! \ud83c\udf84\n\nIf you have your own Holiday card, please drop the photo below and share with us too, any highlights you'd like to give thanks for from this past year. \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\udc47\n\nThank you, God, for a beautiful transformation. \n\nFor a beautiful healing. \n\nFor a wonderful life. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nMerry Christmas & Happy Holidays everyone! \n\nBeaming you love.

        "content": "GOD DID IT!!!\n\nTHE FIRST ENGINEERING GRADUATE IN MY HOME!\n\nAfter my Dad's accident in 2011 that led to the dropout of my 2 elder siblings, I was traumatized if going to school was achievable. As a young boy in Junior Secondary school, I witnessed a transition from Abundance to lack as all our properties were sold to save Dad's life. \n\nAfter Secondary school, I knew I wanted to attend the best Engineering University in Nigeria, the vision was clear even when the money was not there, I took 2 years off. I worked as a primary school teacher during the day (7am-2pm) and retired to the car wash during the evening hours(5pm-7pm). My weekends were the busiest, I worked in a car wash from 7am-7pm (Saturdays & Sundays), each time I wash these cars, I remind myself that I don't belong here, I cried many times due to the scorching sun, cuts on my hand, getting underpaid and I told God to help me. \n\n\nFortunately, I was admitted to study Electrical Electronics Engineering at the Federal University of Technology Owerri (FUTO) in 2015. My parents and siblings were so happy for me but life didn't get easier, I did part-time jobs to cope. Each semester break, I go home continue washing cars. I did this even 3 years as an undergraduate and it was tough. My colleagues (who didn't go to school) at the Car wash mocked me, they said I'm deceiving them that I was in the university, they told my customers that I lied and I'm a bad boy, they even nicknamed me \"I dey school\", It was terrible, I was utterly broken, I was discriminated. With the cuts on my hands and the pain of the salty sweat entering my eyes, I cried to God to help me complete my undergraduate degree.\n\nToday, I'm happy that I'm an Engineering Graduate, the first in my home, I've made my family and friends super proud. I can gladly go to that Car wash and tell my colleagues that I'm done with school and my God is not Dead.\n\nI finished with a Second Class Honors (upper division) and while in the university,  I led over 11 teams, built an Event Company from scratch, established a Charity Foundation (Did Food Drive programs because I know what it means to have nothing), bagged 10 Awards, Won competitions and Prizes, Organized a TEDx event that trended in my school, volunteered in over 18 organizations, passed 80 examinations and got featured thrice in a newspaper.\n\nTake a look at my picture and see the smile on my face, it's a smile of victory, I pray this gown unlocks future degrees and celebrations.\n\nYou see, God didn't fail me, I know he won't fail you too. This story is to inspire you to focus on your dreams and stay True to God. \n\nGod kept to His words.",

Keep water with you. (Take advantage of the situation)\n\n3)  Dress properly even if nobody is looking. \n\n4) Listen carefully. Let them finish before you start speaking.\n\n5) While speaking, moderate your tone. Don't speak too fast or too slow. Take pauses. Keep it conversational. \n\n6) Use the STAR/SOAR approach while answering.\n\n7) Convey your smile and expressions. \nYou might not know it but recruiters can hear your smile and expressions over the call. \n\n8) Avoid sarcasm. The recruiter might misinterpret it.\n\n9) Always pick the phone yourself.\nIf you can't talk at the moment, apologize and ask to reschedule.\n\n\"Sorry, I'm caught up with some errands and won't be able to give the desired attention this call deserves. When can I call back?\"\n\nNow, go and kill it at your next interview!\n\nIn case you need assistance on resume review, career guidance, and interview preparation, book a 1:1 session (Refer link in the first comment).\n\n#jobseeker\u00a0#job\u00a0#careers",

I was so disappointed because my bachelor\u2019s degree was just out of reach. \u201cOh well,\u201d I thought, \u201cguess I\u2019ll have to put that dream aside for now.\u201d Then while working a shift at Alamance Regional, one of my teammates informed me about Cone Health\u2019s tuition reimbursement program. I had assumed it required years of service to be eligible. Turns out, you can qualify after only six months. Thanks to Cone, I earned that bachelor\u2019s degree without needing to take out additional loans. I am so thankful for the trust and faith that I\u2019ve been shown. My optimism has been fully restored. I plan to continue my career and personal development here. I am also seriously considering going back to school for an advanced degree.

Their job is to catalogue and archive, store and retrieve files and ensuring all team members have access to necessary information as and when required.\n\nArchiving is important for legal reasons too. Many businesses accidentally dispose of documents that they legally should be keeping. This helps to mitigate delays, loss and litigations.\n\nHistorical Records and Information:\n\nAn Archivist is the Information Specialist who analyzes, assesses, collects, organizes and preserves this Information which is determined to have long-term value by Archiving.\n\nArchiving is the process by which old, obsolete, inactive information in any formats are safely and securely stored for longer periods of time for future reference and research.\n\nEffectively an archive is a kind of collection of materials that are stored for a very particular reason. Since they provide first-hand information about our history, they are valuable wealth of information to researchers, scholars, students and for our future generation.\n\nMembership: https://lnkd.in/dHt-Qyy",

The blackboard and pens were used as teaching aids. At the turn of the 20th century, Education 2.0 started, where teachers played a guiding role in classrooms and students were active. Computers of the first generation were also used in education. At the end of the 20th century, Education 3.0 was initiated where teachers worked as collaborators and students were active and independent. The computer and the Internet have been used as enabling technology. At present, Education 4.0 is underway, where the role of the teacher is the mentor and the students are active in the classrooms. The courses are completely student-centric and technologies similar to the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is used as a catalyst. Institutions, education departments, administrations, teachers, parents and students must keep themselves familiar with the recent educational trends to step with the world.",

I was awarded the ExxonMobil Scholarship by the Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health at the University of Oxford. The scholarship covers tuition, stipend, health immigration surcharge, travel and visa cost.\n\nI got admission offers into the 5 UK schools I applied to, and I was also nominated for the Commonwealth Shared Scholarship by the University of Bristol.\n\nI am so grateful to God, who consistently performed all the million \u201clittle\u201d miracles, to get me here. I am also grateful to everyone that has contributed to my journey.\n\nMy parents \u2013 whose shoulders I stand on, to reach success.\n\nMy referees \u2013 Prof. Iruka Okeke, Oladapo Adetunji  and Dr. O. S. Alabi (one of my referees submitted a reference letter for me on Christmas day! I am truly blessed to have kind lecturers). I am grateful to Prof. Odeku as well (former dean, Faculty of Pharmacy, UI), who responded swiftly to my requests, and the Acting Vice-Chancellor of the University of Ibadan, who sent me a congratulatory letter.\n\nThose who reviewed my essay - Segun Afolaranmi , Omotayo Olaoye , Aniekan Ekpenyong,  Michael Ojo, DVM. Cynthia Amakiri, Victor Oyebanji DVM, MVSc  and Mr. Onwen.\n\nSpecial thanks to GetIn Education Consulting  I paid and attended the graduate school Bootcamp they organized in 2020 and learnt how to write winning essays, we had practical classes on how to revamp your statement of purpose and CV from average to one that stands out, mistakes to avoid e.t.c. By the time I was done, I knew what a winning application should look like and I started working towards that.\n\nPutting together my application cost me so much time (about 4 months) and mental energy. It was a very intense period for me, because within those months, I was also studying online with the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine for the Postgraduate certificate in Global Health (which is quite demanding), preparing for my Pharmacists Pre-registration Exam and I also had to take the IELTS.  But I am super glad it paid off. I\u2019m grateful for this opportunity, and I look forward to paying it back by using the knowledge and skills I\u2019ll gain from this course, to contribute solutions to health problems, particularly in the field of Infectious Diseases and Antimicrobial Resistance #amr \n\nI have written extensively about my journey to Oxford here https://lnkd.in/eGVzA-22 and I included tips on applying to graduate school at the end.\n\n#MScIHTMOxford\n#OxfordScholar\n#oxforduniversity\n#AdeolaAtOxford\n#IbadanToTheWorld",

Kane received a YELLOW!\n\n\ud83d\udca5Tackle 2 - Robertson lashes out from a standing position, so no impact as no momentum was not there on the Spurs right back.\n\n\ud83d\udc3aIn my opinion this was reckless but did not endanger the player in question. Robertson received a RED!\n\nThe issue here is POLICY and its confusion, the referee is in a place he didn't understand, it simply isn't clear.\n\nSo, the issue here is one player and club suffers. \n\nAdded to this was it personality driven, Kane is England captain \ud83e\udd14. \n\nThe same happens with service leavers.\n\n\ud83d\udca5Policy apparently states a military unit cannot have anyone on barracks talking about Resettlement or Transition.\n\n\ud83d\udc3aIn my opinion this is incorrect and regardless of a contract, service leavers should be afforded every opportunity possible to them if the unit has the ability to do so. \n\nThe issue here is nobody reads JSP 100 or JSP 534 on barracks, so it is not understood, it is very easy to listen to chinese whispers, I think, mmm i believe it is etc. \n\nAdded to this is it personality driven, does the RAO, QM, Education Officer just say so \ud83e\udd14. \n\nSo, the same issue arises, there is confusion and what is left is, the service leaver suffers. \n\nNow, the thing about both instances is, nothing will be done about it, we will continue to see the same failure in policy as simply its not understood. \n\nTo end, what is policy? \n\nIs it a guide, is it definitive, is it the final answer or is it best being understood and then left to every individual to actually make a decision? \n\nI will let you answer and I would be very interested in your thoughts. \n\nServe Well, Leave Well and Flourish!",

        "content": "Yep...\nThere ya have it folks...\n\nThe lid is off the box America...\nIt's time to rise to soaring new heights...\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy wrote to the Audubon Society: \nThe Founding Fathers made an appropriate choice when they selected the bald eagle as the emblem of the nation. The fierce beauty and proud independence of this great bird aptly symbolizes the strength and freedom of America. But as latter-day citizens we shall fail our trust if we permit the eagle to disappear.\n\nThe bald eagle has been the national bird of the United States since 1782, when it was placed with outspread wings on the Great Seal of our country. It appears in many government institutions and on official documents, making it the most pictured bird in all of America. The eagle appears on the president\u2019s flag, the mace of the House of Representatives, military insignia, and billions of one-dollar bills.\n\nThe bald eagle first appeared as an American symbol on Massachusetts copper cent coined in 1776. Since then it has appeared on the reverse side of many U.S. coins, notably the silver dollar, halfdollar and quarter, as well as the gold coins which were christened the eagle, half eagle, quarter eagle, and double eagle. \n\nFor six years, the members of Congress held a bitter dispute over what the national emblem should be. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 1789 that the bald eagle was finally chosen to represent the new nation.\n\nSome eagles have become notable in American history. \u201cOld Abe,\u201d the mascot of a Wisconsin regiment during the Civil War, was a constant target of enemy riflemen, but \nsurvived 42 battle engagements relatively unscathed. \n\nToday, the American bald eagle is protected under the National Emblem Act of 1940. \n\nAlthough once plentiful throughout the continental United States, the bald eagle population has greatly declined in recent times. Farmers and fishermen have killed many eagles for getting too close to their poultry or fishing nets; game keepers have captured them for falconry; and pesticides have killed many eagles. \n\nMost of the bald eagle population can now be found in northern regions of North America and Florida breeding sanctuaries.\n\n #beauty # #military #society #dollar #civil #eddavidson #safedy #thereyahaveit",

For me, quite literally so. Post my father's demise, I witnessed my mother use every crumb we had to pay for my education.

The lack of economic and social capital does not ONLY impact success; it stunts the very dreams we chase. I intend to work at the intersection of public and private sectors to improve access to higher education and make the world a more equal place.\n\nI am incredibly grateful to my alma mater Indian Institute of Management, Kozhikode, my work-school Tata Administrative Services, and Titan Company Limited for being the wind beneath my wings. \n\nThank you to my mentors and recommenders, Harish Bhat, #ProfMathews, Ayan Deb, and Javed KM, for their faith in me. \n\nIt took a village, and I shall be forever grateful to friends and seniors who supported me for over 3 years through countless application essays, GMAT preparations, mock interviews, and for inspiring me to be as awesome as themselves Nishant Dey Purkayastha, Ruchi Singh, Sarmed Rashid, Rahul Srinivasan, Prasad Ganorkar, Priyanka Krishnamoorthy, Tat Sarkar, Akshay Sukthankar, Charanya Kannan.\n\n\n\n\nHarvard Kennedy School #HarvardUniversity #firstgeneration #highereducation",

        "content": "(Update : These days, Young aspirants are studying together because of the high success rate through group studying, quizzes and societal encouragement. Electricity, no longer, is a big problem. In 2017, Patna superintendent of Rail police Jitendra Mishra noticed this dedicated effort of students towards clearing the exams of Railways, Banks, Staff Selection Commission and other Govt departments. He provided identity cards to more than 500 youngsters)\n\nThe #resoluteYoungIndia\n#SasaramJunction #Bihar #SasaramStudyGroups\n#RailwayPlatformCumCoachingCentre\n\n(Content from Business Standard 2018)\nFor two hours every morning and evening, both the platforms 1 and 2 of the railway station turn into a #coachingclass for young people who are aspirants for the #civilservices: The Indian Administrative Service, the state civil service, multiple bank examinations, even entry to the IITs and IIMs. It all began in 2002-03 when a small group of students started coming to Sasaram railway station to study. Now the Sasaram railway station study groups have become an institution.\n \nSenior students \u2014 both those who have been successful and those who have not \u2014 come to the station to coach younger boys in what has become a ritual over the years. \n\nThe reason is : Sasaram station has electricity 24X7. And the power never goes. Mostly, the boys are from Rohtas, the district in Bihar that is hit by Left wing insurgency. In many villages, either there is no power or the electricity is only intermittent. These boys see a government job as the end of their struggles and take advantage of the well lit station to sit under the lamp-post to study. The station has acknowledged its role in shaping careers and has actually issued 500 identity cards to the boys to enable them to come and go freely, using the platform as temporary open classrooms. Some boys don\u2019t go home at all, opting to sleep there at night. They use the platform to take lessons and tips from seniors: Not just for the written examinations but also for interviews. The coaching involves sets of questions on a variety of subjects: Current affairs, mathematics, reasoning and language.\n\n====== Cut to Now ========\nIt is, no longer, the lack of electricity that brings hundreds of aspirants here, but the high success rate. Students recall how even passengers would become emotional seeing the young boys concentrating in the din and would make sure that the students were not disturbed.",

Save the business owner valuable time by avoiding answering and screening telemarketing calls, or \n3. Grow the business by capturing some additional business prospects that may have hung up and called a competitor if their calls were sent straight to VM. \n\nHowever, for some business there is still another great benefit.\u00a0If a CPA, Counselor or Attorney tries to answer their own calls, invariably they will get the \u201clet me ask you one quick question\u201d. Translation, \"I want some of your valuable expertise for free\".\u00a0We simply tell these callers, I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not an attorney/CPA/counselor but I would be happy to schedule some time for you to speak with them. \u00a0\n\nFor the past 20+ years we\u2019ve provided this conduit to for professionals to monetize their skills with callers. We\u2019re a great referral for your CPA friend who doesn\u2019t want to sound rude when people ask for free advice. We\u2019ll answer all their calls and schedule future consultation calls on their calendar for around $2.00/hr.\n\n#business #CPA #businessowners",

        "content": "My Facebook account almost got hacked yesterday and this was how I was able to salvage the situation.\n\nWhat happened to me yesterday was so funny that I began to think how naive users fall prey easily to online hackers.\n\nTwo days ago, while loads of birthday wishes was bombarding my phone, I noticed something strange.\n\nAt first, I didn't pay close attention to it.\n\nThat day, I had many missed calls because I woke up a bit late.\n\nAmong the callers, there was a specific unknown number that called more than 5 times consecutively.\n\nI ignored my observation to reply the birthday messages.\n\nAs I scrolled through my Facebook unread messages, I remember how a guy had earlier requested for my contact number so he can send me a birthday gift - that his P.A would call me.\n\nAirtime... I assumed.\n\nOut of innocence, I gave it out since I felt it isn't a big deal to give my followers chances to call and wish me a hearty birthday - at least for once.\n\nI never knew I was dancing to his tune. A trap!\n\nBefore that day ended, that same number called again, told me he was the P.A to the guy who requested for my contact number on Facebook.\n\nThen he said...\n\n\"Hello, young lady, a 6 digit number was sent to you, check your SMS inbox to confirm and send it to me right away!\".\n\nI was taken aback but for a few seconds.\n\nOf a truth, I saw the 6 digits but I told him point blank that I haven't received any message of such.\n\nHe persisted for about 3mins, but when I wasn't succumbing, he hung up.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAt exactly 7:45am yesterday, he called back and now with a new tactics.\n\nHe requested for the digits again, I lied again and he was like \"Ah, ah you mean you haven't gotten it even till now?\"\n\nCalled again 3:30pm yesterday.\n\nThis was where I began to become suspicious.\n\nMe wey no dey dull myself.\n\nAt this point, I was curious but I didn't make it obvious.\n\n\"Even if the 6digits was sent to me, what will you do with it?\" - I inquired.\n\nHe responded \"It will serve as an evidence to my boss that the 20k birthday gift has been sent to you\".\n\nA link as a confirmation? 20k from a total stranger? I was flabbergasted.\n\nI uttered a word and it was as though I had just stepped on the tail of a roaring lion.\n\n\"Chill, if I...\"\n\nHey, go tell your Papa to chill\" - He blasted!\n\nInstantly, I knew it was an hacker desperate to steal my account for his nefarious business.\n\nI hung up and blocked his number without thinking twice.\n\nWhat baffled me most is that the other guy who earlier messaged me on Facebook in guise of sending a birthday gift had already blocked me on Facebook. Quite funny!\n\nI'm telling you this so you don't fall victim to his accomplice out there.\n\nNot only will your account be hacked, they will ruin your reputation, extort huge money from your followers especially if you've a large audience like me.\n\nCaution: Investigate thoroughly before sending out a link or digits to unknown persons. Festive season is here.\n\n\nBeware.",

I would like to order a pizza.\n \nGOOGLE:  \nDo you want your usual, sir?\n \nCALLER:\nMy usual? You know me?\n \nGOOGLE:\nAccording to our caller ID data sheet, the last 12 times you called you ordered an extra-large pizza with three cheeses, sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms and meatballs on a thick crust.\n \nCALLER:  \nSuper! That\u2019s what I\u2019ll have.\n \nGOOGLE:\nMay I suggest that this time you order a pizza with ricotta, arugula, sun-dried tomatoes and olives on a whole wheat gluten-free thin crust?\n \nCALLER:  \nWhat? I don\u2019t want a vegetarian pizza!\n \nGOOGLE:  \nYour cholesterol is not good, sir.\n \nCALLER:  \nHow the hell do you know that?\n \nGOOGLE:\nWell, we cross-referenced your home phone number with your medical records. We have the result of your blood tests for the last 7 years.\n \nCALLER:\nOkay, but I do not want your rotten vegetarian pizza!  I already take medication for my cholesterol.\n \nGOOGLE:\nExcuse me sir, but you have not taken your medication regularly.  According to our database, you purchased only a box of 30 cholesterol tablets once at Lloyds Pharmacy, 4 months ago.\n \nCALLER:  \nI bought more from another Pharmacy.\n \nGOOGLE:  \nThat doesn\u2019t show on your credit card statement.\n \nCALLER: \nI paid in cash.\n \nGOOGLE:  \nBut you did not withdraw enough cash according to your bank statement.\n \nCALLER:  \nI have other sources of cash.\n \nGOOGLE:\nThat doesn\u2019t show on your latest tax returns, unless you bought them using an undeclared income source, which is against the law!\n \nCALLER:    \nWHAT THE HELL!\n \nGOOGLE:  \nI'm sorry sir, we use such information only with the sole intention of helping you.\n \nCALLER:  \nEnough already!  I'm sick to death of Google, Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and all the others.  I'm going to an island without the internet, TV, where there is no phone service and no one to watch me or spy on me.\n \nGOOGLE:      \nI understand sir, but you need to renew your passport first.

The Retractable Fence Stabilizer (U.S. patent pending), protects the fence post from leaning or breaking at the base. When a hurricane strikes the homeowner is often left to incur most or all of the cost of damages to their fence after insurance companies apply their deductibles and depreciations resulting in thousands of dollars of out of pocket expenses for the homeowner. Our stabilizers are a one time investment for a lifetime of protection that can save you thousands of dollars when a hurricane strikes and are removable! See the attached video of our epic airboat wind speed test!

The city became one of the first \u201czero net energy\u201d cities in the world in 2019, meaning it \u201cprocures or produces more energy via renewable sources than is consumed within city limits,\u201d according to city literature.\u00a0\n  - By charging some city overhead to the revenue-producing LCE, they can also save taxpayers money: $640,000 in 2021, out of a roughly $234 million budget.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n - #BIEDSociety",

        "content": "I observe Shabbat. I have tried to hide at different times but never compromised and it makes me a better lawyer, father, husband, and human. For 26 hours beginning sundown on Friday I turn off my phone and computer, I don\u2019t use electronics and I don\u2019t drive. \n\nWhat I do is affirmatively focus on self-growth. I lean in and nurture my relationship with my kids and beautiful wife. I let my mind rest and allow it to grapple with the challenges of the week in a more creative and innovative way than when I\u2019m in the trenches. I let my perspective zoom out and think about big-picture issues and even do a bit of naval-gazing philosophizing with family and friends.\n\nMost importantly, I evaluate whether I was the kind of lawyer, co-worker, father, and husband that I wanted to be this past week and how I can do better this coming week. \n\nThroughout my career I was told that to do M&A (especially PE), I would have to compromise my Shabbat observance. A partner told me last year, \u201cyou may be the best attorney in the world, but unfortunately, if we get an LOI on Friday night, I need you to turn it back to the client by Saturday night. If you can\u2019t do that, I just can\u2019t work with you. Have you considered Tax?\u201d While I would have loved to work with that person, I am not willing to compromise Shabbat. \n\nShabbat is designed to reinforce that our value is not the sum of our productivity or what we produce. Our value goes beyond our work and beyond the economic value we create. When all the ringing and pinging is gone for 26 hours, you realize that your worth is independent of your work. \n\nJoe Lieberman was an early role model of mine, in part because he observed Shabbat. He was a U.S. Senator and did not compromise Shabbat observance. Not only did he make it work, but it made him a better Senator, a better father, and a better human. He wrote a beautiful book about Shabbat and how everyone (of all faiths or no faith) can benefit by integrating Shabbat into their daily lives by taking moments to self-reflect and discuss deep topics (The Gift of Rest). We had an enjoyable discussion about Shabbat when we met a \u201cfew\u201d years ago (picture in the Comments). \n\nAs we celebrate the holidays with friends and family and move into a new year, we would be well served to integrate a bit of Shabbat into our own lives, to take time to shut off the electronics and be present with our loved ones. These are the moments that have real meaning, these are the moments our children and spouses remember; I would not trade those moments for anything.\n\nWhile I recognize that Shabbat observance could result in a detriment to my career or winning certain clients, the gains to my mental health, peace of mind, creativity, innovation, closeness to family, and overall wellbeing are absolutely priceless. \n\nTo those that celebrate Christmas, wishing you a truly meaningful and peaceful holiday with your loved ones. \n\nShabbat shalom to all.\n\n#privateequity #law #shabbatshalom",

        "content": "\u201c Humanity Is the foundation of any image.  Then comes the journalism aspect, and then the photography.  \n\nLike It or not, a photograph Is an art form, regardless of subject or style. One of the reasons I can make this generalisation Is that as with anything artistic, its not a definitive thing; it means different things to different viewers and Is totally subjective. To one viewer It may be crap, to another It may be superb. Just like music, sculpture, painting, the written word or film, It stirs up a different feeling and thought within anyone who looks at a picture. Its not finite like a mathematical formula but totally infinite in its communication.\n\nIts not your story, It belongs to your subject. You must never forget that.\u201d\n\n\n- Edmond Terakopian - \nLondon-based freelance press photographer.\n\nThe Daily Mirror newspaper named Him  as the author of one of the world's most iconic photographs, referring to His photograph from the July 7th terrorist bombings in London. One of these photographs was also selected for \"100 Photos of the 21st Century: Editions de la Martiniere\". Alongside a third place award in the prestigious World Press Photo awards and being bestowed the title of Photographer Of The Year in the British Press Awards, He has also served as the British Prime Minister's official photographer, as a member of a three photographer team, working directly for the British Prime Minister Tony Blair's office . He Has participated in several group and solo exhibitions, having His work exhibited . He also been published in numerous books. his main areas of work are portraiture, PR, the arts, documentary, news, fashion, commercial and advertising photography, alongside documenting daily life on the streets, capturing candid and natural moments, building a picture of our time.\n\nI usually write about photographers who are not among the living.  For photographers who have left a priceless legacy.  That influenced me.  Who left a mark on me.  I have written very little about photographers while they are still alive.  But this Is one of the pulse-pounding photographers and I am very attached to his work.  A brave connection of a viewer In front of the work of the photographer - It\u2019s a special bond .  Edmond Is one of them.  The seam between photojournalist and artistic photography - He symbolizes for me.  Beyond being a photographer of supreme grace he Is also a wonderful human .  Photographers show us the world, through the lenses of their eyes.  I have a real and sincere fondness for observing the subject Of the world through the lenses of Edmond\u2019s special eye .\n\nPhotography as a language, of all visual languages, Is known to be the most intuitive, completely unmediated and speaks directly to the brain. There Is a factor In photography that evokes the almost physiological response of the word / sound - wow.  The wow factor - I found In his work . \n\nPhoto: \u00a9Opera singer Ida R\u00e4nzl\u00f6v,\nAbout the photo In the first Comment \nEdmond Terakopian \ud83d\udda4",

Any fans of B&W out there?\n\n--\n\nThis post is part of a series that takes a look back at the photo highlights of this past year. Thanks so much everyone for showing interest in my work throughout the year. It means the world!",

        "content": "\u201c Who am I to spout about life, love, happiness? \nAbout whether all's right with the world, or whether it's just a vale of tears... I think it's unbelievable, fabulous, this life of ours\u2026 everything, the birds and the bees, the deer and the antelope, the spacious skies, the foggy dew, the rockabye babies\u2026 My wife's embrace, a landing on the moon, space, time, eternity. \nI don't understand one damn thing about any of it, except that it's enough to keep me In a constant delirium of delight, surprise, enthusiasm, despair, enough to keep me roaming, stumbling, faltering, cursing, adoring, hating the destruction, the violence In myself and others.\n\nI'm not a journalist, an objective reporter. I am a man with likes and dislikes.\n\nI can only do something that I want to do myself. I can only act on my own impulses.\n\nI started taking photos as a reflex...as a kind of diary notation.\n\nThis Is the setting of my film. My hunting ground.\n\nI am so often, very often, actually extremely happy. \nWhy? What is this happiness? What Is happiness? What does 'being happy' mean?\n\nI would love to have a little camera surgically installed In my head. \nWith a mini microphone, highly sensitive, so I could observe and record and look with precision, so I can capture everything I want, all day long. It's a ridiculous idea, of\ncourse, but that's what I would love. There's so much I want to capture and comment on.\n\nI celebrate life. \nI'm no more complex than that. And this means I celebrate everything: love, courage, beauty, but also rage, blood, sweat and tears.\n\nShow the world who you are.\"\n\n\n\n- Eduard van der Elsken - \nwas a Dutch photographer and filmmaker.\n\nHis imagery provides quotidian, intimate and autobiographic perspectives on the European zeitgeist spanning the period of the Second World War into the nineteen-seventies in the realms of love, sex, art, music (particularly jazz), and alternative culture. He described his camera as 'infatuated' . His style is subjective and emphases the seer over the seen; a photographic equivalent of first-person speech.\n\nAt the suggestion of Dutch photographer Emmy Andriesse he moved in 1950 to Paris. He was employed in the darkrooms of the Magnum photography agency, printing for Henri Cartier- Bresson (who was impressed with his street photography), Robert Capa and Ernst Haas. There he met (and in 1954 married) fellow photographer Ata Kand\u00f3 , twelve years his senior, living with her three children among the 'ruffians' and bohemians  of Paris .\n\nA unique figure, Van der Elsken was renowned as a street photographer, and Is recognised as the most important Dutch photographer of the 20th century.\nIn his work, he developed a bold, unconventional and personal style. Van der Elsken's presence resonates throughout his work: he cared about making a personal connection with the people he photographed and, like a playful art director, often staged situations, too.\n\nAbout this Iconic photo and few nots In the first comments.\nand more photos..",

So I requested several photographers to explain why they photograph, and Menty Jamir, Dinesh Khanna and Shivya Kochar responded. I hope several others will and that I will make several episodes of 'Why I Photograph'?\nhttps://lnkd.in/gbe-t_uJ #design #photographers #photography #art #students",

The movie stars James Stewart as George Bailey, a frustrated businessman with unfulfilled dreams who decides to end his life when an angel intervenes.\n\nReviews of the film were mixed, with the New York Times calling it \"weak,\" and initially it was a financial failure. In the 1970s, the film began showing up on TV during Christmastime and quickly became a family favorite. In a particularly romantic scene, George tells Mary about how he is going to lasso the moon for her after the pair walk home from a dance together singing:\n\nBuffalo gals, won't you come out tonight?\nCome out tonight, come out tonight?\nBuffalo gals, won't you come out tonight,\nAnd dance by the light of the moon?\n\nThe song was written in 1844 about the girls in the red light district around the Erie Canal in Buffalo, NY, the site of the canal\u2019s western terminus and where crewmen and other canal workers collected their wages. Musicians changed the words depending on where they were performing (e.g. Boston Gals, Charleston Gals, New York Gals, etc.), but the Buffalo version was the most popular. \n\nScreenwriter Frank Capra, and the movie's stars Donna Reed and Jimmy Stewart have all cited It\u2019s a Wonderful Life as their favorite movie. In his autobiography, Capra took that praise one step further: \u201cI thought it was the greatest film I ever made. Better yet, I thought it was the greatest film anybody ever made.\u201d",

        "content": "I'd like to share something here about myself. My passion projects include Poetry and Music. Every other day I post a Haiku or Long Form poem on Facebook.\n\nI have been performing on my guitar with vocals on a platform called www.sessionslive.com for a while now. Mainly to an audience in Indonesia with some Americans mixed in.\n\nYeah, I know I test the character limit with my recent posts on LinkedIn with the subject matter I have been studying for years. I may speak with assumed authority, but yes, even though key players in the industries I have posted on call on me and recognize me as a knowledgeable source, I have a bit of Peter-pan syndrome mixed in as I have mainly been surrounded by young children in my personal sphere as a father of four young children who create a world of magic in my home. It's hard not to see the world through their eyes.\n\nI have worked/studied from home for eleven years, and I have depended on my musical and poetic abilities to make up for lost time with my friends and family and communicate to them that despite my dedication to my personal professional and educational pursuits that I am here for them and very much trying to remain reachable. \n\nBut I draw inspiration from fellow artists who have \"duel-classed\" an artistic inclination with their professional pursuits and have mentioned them online on LinkedIN\n\nSo tonight, I am posting from my personal life.\n\nI have studied Haiku for 15 years both in Western Academia and under a man referred to as a master in the Japanese styles on Shenro Haiku whom I have mentioned in a previous post regarding #professionaltranslation.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Haiku, this man asked me to begin teaching my personal style in 2014. \n\nThis is the Haiku I wrote this morning and posted online.\n\n~\nTunnel Vision, Haiku\n\nI've burned some bridges\nHoping to rebuild new ones\nFrom wood to concrete\n~Zachary\n\n~\n\nI am also posting something I have not seen someone do in the 5 years I have been posting on LinkedIn. \n\nThis is one of the videos I started making for my children since I have a medical condition with my arms and hands that has developed when I play guitar which creates a certain degree of pain. \n\n*Please understand that I am not trying to use LinkedIn to promote my music professionally on this platform.\n\nFolks. If you've been following my posts over the last few months and want to know who I am, I can't think of any better time that I feel like myself than when I'm playing my gee-tar and singing for my friends and family and recently online.\n\nFeel very free to use the comments section below to share a bit about yourself and your hobbies/passion projects that help you find that work/life balance and decompression. I would love to see it!\n\n\n*For folks not interested in this sort of context as you scroll thinking of the daily grind, please disregard. :) \n\n~Zack\n(OK, getting back to business now)\n#share #poetrycommunity #musiclife #haiku\nhttps://lnkd.in/ekXYRhKW",

The experience will help me and you because I'm Puffy's former artist from Badboy Entertainment trying to do music professionally again. You might remember my song from the late 90's called \"Too Old For Me\" which hit the top ten video list on B.E.T. and MTV. You also might remember my cover of Stevie Wonder titled, \"I Never Dreamed You'd Leave In Summer\" on the late great DMX's movie named BELLY. So since I have my own studio, I would basically sing the lyrics, possibly write them, and send them back to you. I charge cheap and require points. Because it would be messed up if my voice is on something that goes double Platinum and I ain't getting paid for it \ud83e\udd23. So hmu. My Email is childersjerome@yahoo.com.

But I must tell you that Music Biz is WAY more than what NARM used to be. It supports the music industry well beyond the yearly conference.\n\nOfferings like webinar series, daily email feeds, virtual suite events, action committee gatherings addressing timely industry issues are offered to members throughout the year. And academic partnerships have also been one of the pillars of Music Biz which is especially appealing to me due to my own personal crusade to mentor the next wave of young music professionals.\n\nSo, yea I\u2019m pretty hyped. I\u2019m reinvigorated about being a part of this crazy, fun, always-changing industry. Get ready I\u2019ll be hitting up many of you about the benefits of becoming a member or becoming a more engaged member. Don\u2019t even try to ghost me! #musicbiz2022, #nextgenu",

And music schools didn't offer the level of flexibility and choice I needed. The vision was then born to build a digital marketplace that offers easier access for everyone to take music lessons and enable talented and passionate music teachers to turn their talent into their profession - part-time or full-time.\n\nThis morning, I took my first cello lesson after enjoying breakfast with my family. The lesson took place live-online in my home office with one of our talented cello teachers on Matchspace, the platform to find music lessons when, where and with whom you want. \n\nSince our launch last summer, Matchspace has attracted more than 100 talented and passionate music professionals. From piano, guitar or singing to didgeridoo, bagpipes, or electronic music production, Matchspace offers maximum choice and flexibility to take music lessons. \n\nThank you Olivier Kipfer Fabian Felix Weber Bobby Leu Julian Weber Lhatul Wangmo and the entire Selise team for all your efforts, dedication and support. I feel honored and grateful to work with such great people.\n\napp.matchspace.com\n#Matchspace #passiondrivenlearning",

Recently my husband and I were getting ready to make a pretty big move in our lives, and every day up to that move seemed to get shorter and shorter. Yet, I decided that capturing those feelings of joy in photos was a top priority. And as my luck would have it, the stars aligned, Alice Patterson was available as was my \u201cstylist\u201d aka my niece Shauna. \u00a0\u00a0\nI wondered why in the midst of everything that was going on at the time why this was so important to me. And then I realized the Caf\u00e9 grounds me. It\u2019s hard to believe but this little Caf\u00e9 With a Cause turned 12 this month, and over the past 12 years the Caf\u00e9 has been a safe landing, for not only those seeking services and the community, but for me\u2013 It\u2019s been my exhale. \u00a0\nI started Ophelia\u2019s Place almost 20 years ago. I \u201cretired\u201d almost 10 years ago, realized I didn\u2019t have a succession plan in place for said retirement, returned, and yes I\u2019m still here. All of my focus since has been on long term sustainability. Caf\u00e9 at 407 began as a way to raise awareness about the cause, create a revenue stream for OP, and feel a little less alone in the world. The Caf\u00e9 is our way of being responsible to funding the work of OP. And if I\u2019m being fully transparent, that work is hard and funding that work is even harder... \nhttps://lnkd.in/djiujqpS",

Notre offre couvre les besoins familiaux, scolaires et sportifs, avec comme marque leader Tissaia qui s'est fait une sacr\u00e9e place dans la notori\u00e9t\u00e9 des marques textiles. Et, au total, un volume d'affaires de 1,3 milliard: jupes, pulls, chaussant, dessus, par-dessus et dessous... \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude04 Pas mal pour des anciens \u00e9piciers !\n\nA l'origine de l'histoire des centres E.Leclerc, mes parents jugeaient important de se diff\u00e9rencier des coll\u00e8gues alimentaires en pr\u00e9sentant une gamme accessible de linges de maison, de v\u00eatements pour enfants et un peu de chaussures. \n\nUne initiative tr\u00e8s r\u00e9ussie des groupes Monoprix et Prisunic avait cr\u00e9e un r\u00e9el engouement pour ce march\u00e9 grand public. Passionn\u00e9es, autour de ma m\u00e8re H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Leclerc, des dizaines de femmes adh\u00e9rentes de notre mouvement ont d'abord tent\u00e9 d'obtenir le droit de vendre des grandes marques moins ch\u00e8res. \n\nMais m\u00eame si Daniel Hechter avait conc\u00e9d\u00e9 livrer quelques pulls, vestes et pantalons, les fabricants ont pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 investir dans les chaines sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es en faisant fabriquer en Asie. \n\nDu coup, les Leclerc ont lanc\u00e9  leur marque : Tissaia est devenu un vrai rep\u00e8re des achats familiaux et a m\u00eame eu un joli succ\u00e8s dans la mode. \n\nC'est 40% des ventes aujourd'hui et ce secteur textile permet \u00e0 l'enseigne de se diversifier \u00e9norm\u00e9ment en province par rapport \u00e0 Lidl, Aldi, Netto, Intermarch\u00e9 qui surench\u00e9rissent en ce moment sur le r\u00e9veillon. Bon, nous aussi, mais pour faire un cadeau au copain ou \u00e0 madame : un petit bijou du Man\u00e8ge, un joli pull ou un parfum \"Une heure pour soi\", on va chez E.Leclerc. \ud83d\udc4d\n\nOn doit cette performance textile \u00e0 l'obstination d'une centaine d'adh\u00e9rentes et de collaboratrices qui, anim\u00e9es par Fabienne Poilbout, s'appellent Dolly, Marianne, Christ\u00e8le, Sadia, Olivia, Marie, Sarah, Quentin et Val\u00e9rie.  \n\nNB : \u00e0 l'occasion, j'invite \u00e0 aller visiter la formidable exposition pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e aux Arts D\u00e9co \u00e0 Paris pour d\u00e9couvrir le r\u00f4le immens\u00e9ment pr\u00e9conisateur des collections Monoprix, \u00e0 une \u00e9poque o\u00f9 la distribution ne se satisfaisait pas de faire du benchmark. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c.

In order to provide the audio specialists and artists with an idea of how I imagine the song sounding, I\u2019ve been recording myself singing the new lyrics along to the backing track.

        "content": "I recently spoke in an online discussion on use of animation in international development and research. Summary:\n\nResearch and data are often complex and technical. Well-produced animation simplifies and creates connections.\n\nMuch of an animation project is not visualisation. It is audience analysis, plain language, emotional buy-in, and good sound. Visualisation often comes surprisingly late in the process.\n\nIt's a team effort. See the visual below. A production may involve a writer, storyboarder, narrator, animator(s), audio specialist(s), and promoters. And of course, there is the researcher with the important data, too.\n\nAverage reading age level in the UK = 9. Many people (and especially researchers and technical specialists!) over-estimate this number. Aim low and easy. Plain language is not dumb language. Visuals help a lot.\n\n10% of the UK population is dyslexic. 1 in 5 people have a disability that may be motor, cognitive, visual, or hearing-related. Audiences' ability to understand your research can be affected by attention, physical disability, emotional hardship, injury, language barriers, learning disability, low literacy, nutrition insecurity, time restrictions, and unfamiliarity with technology. Animations, visuals, and sound can enable more audiences to connect with your research.\n\nWell-planned animation, visuals, and sound are excellent vehicles for research and knowledge. This concept is not new or ground-breaking. But it is still under-utilised.\n\nAnimation goes where cameras cannot. It can communicate the abstract and also the technical. When it is done well, it can really change the way people see things.",

If I am an educator where do I go to find outstanding immersive learning content?  I hear your pause....nowhere yet.  I have interviewed and met with many outstanding organisations that have developed incredible immersive experiences to help learners harness the power of 3-d spatial education (some of which I have included in this image and apologizes to many others whom I didn't represent due to lack of space:).   We shouldn't have to search for hours to curate and consolidate a list of great VR applications to promote and instil immersive learning in our schools and educational organizations.  We need someone to step up to become the next \"NETFLIX\" for educational VR apps.  #learning",

We are highly focused on this! \n\nOur goal is to provide independent artists with the best music promotion platform and services globally. \n\nSome great highlights about this year at Groover: \n\n\ud83c\udfb8 We now have 73 000 artists subscribed on Groover in more than 100 countries, and a community of 1 500 active music curators who provided 1 000 000 feedback trough Groover. Artists got visibility, partnerships, labels signatures, sharing on social media, live opportunities, playlist addition thanks to us! \n\n\ud83e\udd16 We now have a working recommandation system that helps artists to connect with music curators that are more likely to enjoy their music. It improve their chance to success, and simplify curation process for music pros! \n\n\u2b55\ufe0f We launched Groover Obsessions, the first artist accelerator towards success that will continue to accelerate the most promising artists detected on Groover, already 50 artists signed to this new amazing program. \n\n\ud83e\uddbe We acquired Soonvibes, a music platform in the electronic scene that helped us to offer more opportunities for techno and house artists. \n\n\ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udfa4 It was the year of our first NFT drops with our friends at Pianity! For some of the artists who got great results on Groover, it was a new way to raise funds and get new fans. \n\n\ud83c\udf08 Creator Economy was definitely trendier this year than we started Groover in 2018 :) It is great, because our vision (and positioning) has always been to address the music promotion vertical in the space (music artists still are the most numerous creators in release volume!). Having more awareness, partners and people interest in the space opened opportunities for collaborations. \n\n\ud83c\udf0e Our community of artists is growing in very different countries: in Europe, in the US, in Brazil, in Canada ... as well as our community of curators. \n\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 We developed a lot our growth in the US and we are about to launch an office there. More partnerships and cool news to come. \n\n\ud83c\udfa4 Events were back and our showcase at La Marbrerie in Montreuil was full in December to celebrate the 1 year anniversary of Groover Obsessions! What a great moment to see curators, artists and the team for this live event (Dorian Rafael) \n\n\ud83d\ude80 We raised a round of $7m with great investors who support our long term vision. Thanks so much Partech (\ud83d\ude4f Alison) and Bpifrance (\ud83d\ude4f Guillaume), as well as all the investors who helped us for the support. \n\nThanks a lot to the team for this amazing year! Dorian Rafael Sara Santiago Lorenzo Timoth\u00e9e Louise Marguerite Anthony Emma Ambre Antoine Thiago Mathilde Maxime Achraf Michael Jonas\n\nWe are looking for more people to join us in Q1 with some great offers in HR, in Marketing, in Curators Partnerships and in Tech \ud83d\ude0e More about our offers below \ud83d\udc47",

        "content": "CANADA GETS NEW ANIMAL CRUELTY INVESTIGATION UNIT\u2026\n\nCanada\u2019s first Animal Cruelty Investigation unit has been created with the job of investigating and punishing forms of animal cruelty.\n\nThe unit has been 2 years in the making and has been assisted by several animal specialists. Its aim is to prioritize and crack down on all cases of animal cruelty. This type of unit is new to Canada, despite the fact that many other parts of the world use a similar system, including the US. \n\nStaff Sgt. Anna Sinclair said, \u201cResearch has shown there in an unequivocal link between animal cruelty, domestic violence, child and elder abuse investigations. Offenders who abuse animals are likely to commit other violent crimes causing harm to persons and society in general.\u201d\n\nMore than 400 cases of animal cruelty were investigated last year, showing just how urgent the need is to create a specific unit for dealing with animal cruelty. \n\nCanadian law enforcement was more eager to assist in creating the special unit when animal cruelty was clearly linked to other forms of abuse and violence. Const. Ilka Cunningham said, \u201cIt started with our love for animals, and then we realized there\u2019s a much bigger picture here, and we quickly recognized the link to child abuse, domestic violence. It\u2019s rarely ever just animal abuse. It always affected humans in a way as well.\u201d \n\nThis is amazing news for animal lovers everywhere as it shows just one more area of the world that is taking animal cruelty seriously. With the cases growing by the year, it is more urgent than ever for animal abuse to be dealt with.\n\nLink to more articles - \nhttps://lnkd.in/gaqxXJ-J",

We managed to bring the industry under one roof for the first time after two years of pandemic, both in person and online. Together we were able to prove to the world that Hong Kong stays resilient and strong. \n\nOn behalf of FINNOVASIA, I cant express enough gratitude to all our partners, speakers, attendees and sponsors. \n\nEspcially to Invest Hong Kong, Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) and Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), Securities and Futures Commission and Insurance Authority.\n\nYour trust and support allowed us to make this event happen. Thank you!\n\nPersonally I am grateful to my co-founder Vila Wong and everyone in FINNOVASIA. The team has been working tirelessly over the last few months behind the scene. You made this work despite all the challenges and uncertainty we faced. I am proud of each of you. This is your moment and your success!\n\nI am also feeling very happy that the conference allowed many event industry professionals to get back to work after months out of business. \n\nCongratulations to over 300 on-site crew and support staff behind the stage, sound, light and video engineers, stage managers, computer animation specialists, technicians, designers, construction crews, volunteers and interns, customer service, stage MCs, production agencies, security personal, venue assistants, video streaming team, app developers and many many more.\n\nHope to see you in 2022!\n\n#teamwork #hkfintechweek #hkftw #hkftw21",

It was unheard-of, & it did not help that whitening toothpaste as a category had flopped\n\nPeople want white teeth, but will not take the extra effort! \n\nThe launch did not have a large budget. Internationally, Orbit had a successful property called pH Balance in the mouth, post eating food. Consumption was driven by the build-up of plaque & the need to balance pH\n\nInitially, that was used in India too, not very successfully\n\u00a0\nNaresh Gupta was leading strategy at Grey & pushed the client to look at Orbit White as an indulgence & not as a health product\n\nNaresh says \u201cWe were clear: white teeth have to be the drama, we could have the usual 'whiteness is attractive' story, but we wouldn't have succeeded in making a mark\u201d\n\nSo the team started with dirty yellow teeth, leading to a cow who chews cud. Sandipan Bhattacharya then wrote scripts with the Animal Specialist & his Volunteer Cow\n\nThe commercial was made by Pushpendra Mishra on a shoestring budget\n\nA photocopying machine operator became the lead actor (it was his 1st TVC) & his unpolished dialogue is the way he normally spoke\n\n300% increase in sales!\n\nFOR MORE VISIT MY BLOG - link in comments",

        "content": "I observe Shabbat. I have tried to hide at different times but never compromised and it makes me a better lawyer, father, husband, and human. For 26 hours beginning sundown on Friday I turn off my phone and computer, I don\u2019t use electronics and I don\u2019t drive. \n\nWhat I do is affirmatively focus on self-growth. I lean in and nurture my relationship with my kids and beautiful wife. I let my mind rest and allow it to grapple with the challenges of the week in a more creative and innovative way than when I\u2019m in the trenches. I let my perspective zoom out and think about big-picture issues and even do a bit of naval-gazing philosophizing with family and friends.\n\nMost importantly, I evaluate whether I was the kind of lawyer, co-worker, father, and husband that I wanted to be this past week and how I can do better this coming week. \n\nThroughout my career I was told that to do M&A (especially PE), I would have to compromise my Shabbat observance. A partner told me last year, \u201cyou may be the best attorney in the world, but unfortunately, if we get an LOI on Friday night, I need you to turn it back to the client by Saturday night. If you can\u2019t do that, I just can\u2019t work with you. Have you considered Tax?\u201d While I would have loved to work with that person, I am not willing to compromise Shabbat. \n\nShabbat is designed to reinforce that our value is not the sum of our productivity or what we produce. Our value goes beyond our work and beyond the economic value we create. When all the ringing and pinging is gone for 26 hours, you realize that your worth is independent of your work. \n\nJoe Lieberman was an early role model of mine, in part because he observed Shabbat. He was a U.S. Senator and did not compromise Shabbat observance. Not only did he make it work, but it made him a better Senator, a better father, and a better human. He wrote a beautiful book about Shabbat and how everyone (of all faiths or no faith) can benefit by integrating Shabbat into their daily lives by taking moments to self-reflect and discuss deep topics (The Gift of Rest). We had an enjoyable discussion about Shabbat when we met a \u201cfew\u201d years ago (picture in the Comments). \n\nAs we celebrate the holidays with friends and family and move into a new year, we would be well served to integrate a bit of Shabbat into our own lives, to take time to shut off the electronics and be present with our loved ones. These are the moments that have real meaning, these are the moments our children and spouses remember; I would not trade those moments for anything.\n\nWhile I recognize that Shabbat observance could result in a detriment to my career or winning certain clients, the gains to my mental health, peace of mind, creativity, innovation, closeness to family, and overall wellbeing are absolutely priceless. \n\nTo those that celebrate Christmas, wishing you a truly meaningful and peaceful holiday with your loved ones. \n\nShabbat shalom to all.\n\n#privateequity #law #shabbatshalom",

It was both joyful and challenging.\n\nWhatever the year brought to you, I hope things were positive on balance. And if that wasn't always possible, I hope that you found pockets of rest and reprieve now and again.\n\nOne of the joys of this year for me was starting the Surfacing podcast with Andy Vitale. An added pleasure was that our audio producer is my son, Rhys. He's also the announcer AND wrote the theme music. So Andy and I thought it would be fun to have Rhys on as a guest for a year-end deep dive.\n\nWe talk about many things. Andy and I touched on how the podcast is going and some changes for next year. Rhys talks about how what he learns while editing Surfacing influences him as a band tour manager--and what it's like to be back out on the road in a pandemic. And to honor Andy's unquenchable thirst for holiday \"stuff\" (any and all holidays), I recorded a version of In the Bleak Midwinter for your ambient listening pleasure. So, grab a cup of peppermint hot chocolate and enjoy this year-end episode of Surfacing.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/ddD9dpS3\n#yearend #teamleadership #holidaymusic",

Throughout 40 States, we spent the Summer months together laughing, joking, and going city-to-city on the tour buses (then private jets!). Years later, she brought me back to launch her fragrance 'Fantasy' and then market the 'Onyx Hotel Tour'. In Dec 2008, right before her conservatory - we spent her final 'free' Birthday together in Bel Air. It was very hard for me to hear her statement today in court. She was an incredible person - who believed in me even before I believed in myself. She taught me so much about the power of music, art and dance.  Below are three of my favorite pictures of us together - my favorite is on the left during our first trip to LA together. I always wished we could meet up again - and maybe today we are one day closer.  #FreeBritney #Britney #britneyspears #mentalhealthmatters #mentalhealth #diversity",

Tour Management will always have a special place in my heart, and I managed to fit a lifetime's worth of experiences into my time on tour, but I am very much looking forward to a new challenge and testing myself in this new role.\n\nSix Shooter is a company that I have had the pleasure of working with as a client for several years now and I could not be more delighted to be joining such a progressive, inclusive and supportive team. I will still be consulting on a number of touring and non-touring projects moving forward, and may even dust off the production case from time to time, so I hope to see each and every one of you out there at festival catering sooner rather than later, but in the meantime I'm looking forward to more quality time at home (and on my bike!).",

        "content": "Spoke to my neighbor yesterday for an hour. He told me he was earning more than 1.5 lakhs in his last job as a Tour Manager. He has traveled around the world and has 15+ yrs of exp. in the travel industry. Last year he lost his job after the lockdown.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe told me he is lucky that his wife is working with an IT company and taking the lead of the family in time of crisis. Everyone in the family respects her in a different way now.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n5 years back when his daughter was born, it was not the same. Everyone in the family told his wife to give up her job and look after her baby full-time. But she was determined to manage both. And she did with sheer determination and hard work.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTowards the end of the conversation, he told me that in the last couple of years he couldn\u2019t spend much time with his family as he had to travel a lot. \n\nHe isn\u2019t desperate to go back to corporate life. It might take some time, but it will happen eventually.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFor the moment he considers himself employed at home looking after the family doing household work, spending time with his daughter and he reports directly to the CEO - his wife. \n\nQuestion:  Why is our society over-critical about women working after having a baby? Are companies doing enough to support mothers manage work and family?",

Pack comfortable clothes that you love and that fit well. Limit to two pairs of shoes and bring rain gear. Always bring a swimsuit since you never know if your hotel may have a pool!\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 You\u2019ll never forget your phone, but charging cords, headphones, and a power adaptor to compensate for different wattage / outlets in different countries are all musts that may be a bit easier to overlook!\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Always call your bank to let them know that you will be traveling. It\u2019s best to carry a couple of credit cards and your debit card with you. Snap a pic of each card front and back, just in case. \n\nSound off: Let us know your own top travel tip!",

My thesis, titled: \"Enhanced generation and detection of ultrafast laser-induced acoustic signals\" explores techniques to increase the signal strength from laser-induced acoustic signals applicable in the semi-conductor manufacturing industry.\n\nAl lot of people deserve recognition for the thesis I am presenting you with today, and they are all mentioned in the acknowledgements inside the thesis itself. I would like to highlight one person in particular without whom this work would not have been possible: my promotor and mentor Paul Planken.\n\nThe cover art of my thesis has been hand painted by my amazing girlfriend Fleur Kuijpers. During my PhD I have done a lot of research on the metal gold, which is represented here by the gold circle. Inside the gold circle a diversity of colors are present, symbolizing the different colors of light I used to investigate photo-acoustic effects during my PhD.\n\nI will defend my Thesis to obtain the degree of Doctor on Friday the 28th of January at 16:00 in the Agnietenkapel in Amsterdam.",

Since 2006, I have been a member of the LinkedIn Community. I thoroughly enjoy the updates and news articles shared here - thanks all! However, I often wonder, should I share something? But I\u2019m damn proud of the last few months so here it goes\u2026\u00a0\n\nIn June 2021, the green light was given for the rollout of Insights Discovery as our communications framework within the AWS Startups Segment. Thanks to Eric Feagler and Tracy Goodman for the support. And couldn't have done without my entire team: Nathan Jordan Siobhan Connor Nikki Gomez Deniece Tan Nicole De Silva Samuel Weller! Thank you! \n\nPersonally, here are my stats in the last 6 months of the Insights Discovery rollout: \n- 650+ Startups Amazonians\u00a0participated in my sessions\n- 112+ hours of facilitation\u00a0\n- 75+ sessions \n\nWhy do I think THIS post is worth it? Because: no matter how you look at it, we can all learn to be better communicators. It\u2019s such a deep and dynamic topic, yet so simple and solvable at the same time.\u00a0\n\nA few shoutouts: having learned the true meaning of hustle and grit at my 12 years at Conductor\u2026 shoutout to Seth Besmertnik and the entire team (congrats on the new raise!).  And Sara Oakes thanks for introducing me to Insights Discovery while we were both at Conductor. \n\nThank you to Elaine Lindsay and Tim Kauffman (and the entire Insights team) for all you do for AWS!\n\nLastly, to those that have joined my sessions: thank you. Throughout the rollout, I iterated and learned to deliver your results, be customer obsessed, earn your trust and dive deep (see what I did there\u2026)\n\nHere\u2019s the 2022 and keeping Insights Discovery Alive!",

Our 2020 graduate cohort did a stellar job captaining the teams.\n\u00a0\nEarlier this month, we held our virtual awards night, celebrating the outstanding designs created by our 17 teams. It was amazing to hear how each of our teams tackled the task we set to create an urban green space \u2013 incorporating innovative sustainability concepts and providing a connection with nature.\n\u00a0\nI was honoured to be one of the judges of this competition, alongside Shane Cashman who created the initial concept for this event three years ago, Eva Hinkers, Bronagh Maguire and Rena Garrett. This competition truly showcases the value of combining diverse viewpoints and it was wonderful to virtually celebrate our teams and congratulate our winners.\n\u00a0\nIf you\u2019d like to find out more about our Equality, Diversity and Inclusion initiatives at Arup, send me a message.\n\u00a0\n#Equality #Diversity #Inclusion",

As a Job Captain at QA, Cesar works on project coordination and technical aspects within design. \n\nOutside of work, Cesar loves traveling. In fact, before COVID-19, Cesar would take vacation time to travel every three months. One spot on his favorites list is Thailand because aspects of it remind him of home in Mexico. With his extensive traveling experience, he has visited 6 of the 7 continents (Africa is next) and has lived in four different countries. \n\nSay hello \ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffc to Cesar!\n\n#MeetQA #designerlife #sanfrancisco #womanownedbusiness #minorityownedbusiness #architecture #interiordesign #bayareadesign #globaldesign #meettheteam",

Increased storage, increased productivity & downsizing current fleet. \n\nThis was the result of installing the Aislemaster, and this particular one in their own company colours which is always a nice touch \ud83d\udc4c.\n\nSo if you are running out of room, reach out to us. Our layout specialists will configure your existing space, and maximise storage to possibly an additional 30-50%. This is all achievable not by moving to a bigger warehouse but just by simply changing your Forklift.\n\nI would like to give a special thank you to George Hewitt from Midac Batteries for the recommendation \ud83d\ude4f\n\n #logistics #transportation #help #warehouse #customerservice #fleetmanagement",

With encouragement and trust from my leaders and colleagues, I recognized my skills for marketing communications and people management. I was further empowered when I was picked to attend the Reed Elsevier Leadership Academy, and the Six Sigma Yellow Belt course. Looking back, I realize that ordinary days at work were actually special, because I was gaining knowledge from the daily interactions and fostering great working relationships. I got promoted to Integrated Marketing Campaigns Supervisor, where I led designers and campaign managers. It was hard, \ud83d\ude05 but I kept going until I found fulfillment amidst the challenges. \n\nIt's 2021 and I'm progressing into the digital space, while still tapping into my design roots. I'm happily embracing the role of Digital Marketing Supervisor for LN Japan & Korea as I immerse in the B2B practices of two amazing Asian countries.

They had just purchased another slab formwork system from a competing international formwork supplier. We challenged them to use PERI Alphadeck on the same project, at the same time, on the same level, with the same workers.  In doing this, they were quickly able to see the benefits of the PERI Alphadeck in comparison to the competition.  \n\nWhat they noticed with PERI Alphadeck:\n\n1. Faster cycling times\n2. Less components to handle\n3. Lighter components\n4. Local design/engineering & on-site support\n5. Immediate product Availability in Thailand\n6. Cleaner and more aesthetically pleasing concrete finish\n7. Much more...\u2026\n\nThis side-by-side real-time comparison, resulted in them confirming a purchase of 5000m2 of PERI Alphadeck for the project you see here in the pictures.  \n\nPERI Thailand is proud to say that our entire team of Sales, Engineers, Designers, Product Specialists, and warehouse are all located in Thailand. We are committed to serve the Thailand construction market now, and well into the future. #construction #formwork #PERI #engineering #concrete",

I won't tag and I won't name them all but Chris Talbot, Naked Marshmallow team, Amy Faggo, Louise Baker, Hawkens Gingerbread, Matt & Jim of Cocktail Delivery, Tony's Chocolonely, the team at Bookers, Davpack, TTK, Cathy Moseley, Divine Box, Lesley So, Jarrick, Made For Drink crew, Peoples Captain, British Food Box, Joe & Sephs and so many more that have come to my rescue or helped us improve our offerings. \n\nOur partners that help us function each day or have helped us in some way this year; Vibrant, Sean Clare, Kydd Cleaning, Action Coach, Mr Shaw, Levain ... thank you.  \n\nWe even started our own networking club with the added bonus that it's fuelled by beer ... thank you to all those that have attended and spent a Thursday each month discussing & laughing with us. I genuinely can't wait to get going again in Jan. \n\nLastly but always top of our list are our brilliant customers ... you are amazing for letting us be part of your wonderful celebrations. Far too many to mention but you've all brightened up some tough days with your last minute requests or very specific needs (we do love a challenge!)\n\nThat's about it for 2021 but one last THANK YOU to anyone reading this that has liked a post, told a friend, suggested to someone that they use Colleague Box or has tagged us in a post ... it's always appreciated. \n\nHave an amazing Christmas & New Year.\n\nAdam",

After doing this again for the primary, I still had this in mind and I had to figure out what my life would look like and how I wanted to continue to do this work. I have spent this year working with candidates, organizations and progressive causes that I truly believe in and I have found peace and absolute joy in this new work. I decided that I would take a huge leap of faith and create the space that I wanted and I started a political consulting firm. \n\nMy new firm T. Booker Strategies, LLC, was formed and I am very excited to share this with you. My website: tbookerstrategies.com is official and I invite you to take a look. \n\nGod has taken care of me every single step of the way and I am truly grateful. I am humbled by all of the support I have received. I look forward to connecting with all of you regarding my newest endeavor. Please dont hesitate to reach out to me with any questions and thank you again for all the support!",

I thoroughly enjoyed my four and a half years, making this a bittersweet moment. Thanks to the unmatched resources Michigan and University of Michigan Athletics offers I will walk away from this experience with several valuable life lessons, a few of which I\u2019d like to share:\n\n1. Life will give you exactly what you need, when you need it. This may come in forms of adversity. Embrace the suck.\n2. Fundamental principals that many of us learn as children such as hard work, accountability, and integrity, will carry you through life if you allow them. KISS.\n3. Be the one to hold the highest standard for yourself.\n\nI owe a lot of thanks to my family at Michigan Field Hockey. To Maurice J. Washington,  MSA and the rest of the MACC (Michigan Athletics Career Center) for their amazing help with career development - a resource every Michigan student-athlete should take advantage of. To Joan Booker and Jeff Magnell and everyone else at JDM Systems Consultants where I learned and grew amply as a young professional.\u00a0\n\nI am excited to take these lesson with me to AMBE Engineering LLC, where I will start the New Year as a financial analyst.

I wouldn't be where I am without the leadership and support from so many people.\n\nIn January, I will be joining the Bungie team and am still in disbelief that I have been granted the opportunity to join this organization which I hold in the highest of regards.

        "content": "Recently, I was asked how the water we drink that goes into our stomachs causes a MAC infection in our lungs.\n\nThe answer is two-fold: by inefficient swallowing and gastric reflux.\n\n As previously discussed, all of us micro-aspirate liquid into our lungs throughout the day. This might be from liquid \u201cgoing down the wrong pipe\u201d as can happen with swallowing issues, coughing, or \u201cjust because.\u201d Although a certain number of aspirations is considered normal and not a concern for those with healthy immune systems and lungs, this may not be the case for people with impaired airways.\n\nGastroesophogeal Reflux is another way bacteria can enter the lungs. Both acid and non-acid gastric refluxate can come up from the stomach and enter the lungs. This liquid can contain bacteria that have not been killed off by our stomach acid and possibly cause infection. \n\nOne way to help prevent reflux is to take GERD precautions. These precautions might include: \n\n\ud83e\udda0Raising the head of your bed\n\ud83e\udda0Not eating several hours before lying down\n\ud83e\udda0Losing weight if overweight\n\ud83e\udda0Not eating trigger foods\n\nIn addition to reducing swallowing issues and GERD, we can also reduce the MAC in our drinking water. Boiling water for 10 minutes or drinking spring water will greatly reduce this exposure and is something I do. \n\nIf you choose to drink spring water, do not drink from a water cooler as a MAC biofilm might be lining the inside of the machine. The same is true for refrigerator filtered water and ice and Brita-like charcoal pitchers.\n\nAs I have said in two previous posts regarding environmental exposure precautions, not everyone with bronchiectasis will get a MAC infection. However, there is about a 10-20% chance you will and the precautions I have laid out can reduce that probability. \n\nSome BE and MAC specialists tell their patients to just live their lives and to not try to control bacteria that is everywhere in our environment. Others suggest taking preventive measures. So it is best to have this conversation with your doctors and see what they recommend.\n\nRemember, we have a life-long condition so you can always make changes gradually over time. \n\n#bronchiectasis #maclungdisease\n#ntmlungdisease",

By 2024, 1.2 billion Chinese will be in the middle class, making up one quarter of the world total. China already makes up the largest middle-class consumption market segment in the world and is a \u201cpriority market\u201d for major multinational firms.\n\nAre you making it a priority?\n\n\u201cMac, I don\u2019t speak Chinese!\u201d\n\nWell, as an example, English is widely used in Hong Kong (Pop. 7.5 million).  Can people/companies there afford coaching?  Well, it\u2019s nearly a quarter of my work.  They can.  \n\nThere is a big market there in China.  It\u2019s about 22% of my work.  52% is in the US.  Often helping companies transition staff overseas or lead multinational teams.\n\nRegardless of nationality, both clients are congruent with each other: urban, success-oriented and upwardly mobile.\n\nWhat are you doing in October to boost your coaching overseas?  How would it feel to expand?\n\n\u975e\u5e38\u611f\u8c22\u60a8!\n\nCharlotte Nicholson ACC, CPC, ELI-MP Tricia Tahsuda, BS, MHSM, SHRM Adrian \ud83c\udf31 Trumbo, PCC, CPC Audra Christie, CPC, ELI-MP Susan J Hilger, ACC, ELI-MP Kimberly Sennerikuppam, CPC, ELI-MP\n#marketing #work #strategy #sales #coaching",
