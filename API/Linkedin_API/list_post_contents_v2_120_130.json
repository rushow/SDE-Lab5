His provincial government career culminated in him serving as deputy minister for a variety of portfolios between 2010 and 2019.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis time spent as CEO of the B.C. Ambulance Service, deputy minister of human, community, social services and deputy minister of innovation and advanced education have provided him with insight into the health system provincially and across Canada. David\u2019s expertise in health innovation acquired from his time on the Genome Alberta and National Institute of Nanotechnology boards will also bring value to his position on the Canadian Blood Services board of directors. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nWatch to hear how David hopes to inform the next four years in his role on the Canadian Blood Services board. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nTo meet David Morhart, click here: https://lnkd.in/d-7ZQgvj\n\n***\nAppointed by the provincial and territorial ministers of health (except Quebec), the board of directors comprises 13 members. Each director serves for a term of four years.\u00a0\n\nIn December 2021, two directors and our board chair completed their time on the Canadian Blood Services board. We thank them for their commitment, guidance and leadership.",
